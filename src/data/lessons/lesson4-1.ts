  title: "Synthesising Multiple Sources",
  examples: [],
  notes: [
    "Synthesising means combining ideas from multiple sources to create a new, broader understanding.",
    "Unlike summary (one source), synthesis shows how different works relate to each other.",
    "Key relationships: 1) Consensus (agreement), 2) Contrast (disagreement), 3) Hierarchy (one idea supports another).",
    "Use reporting verbs to show relationships: 'While Author A claims X, Author B argues Y.'",
    "Synthesis creates value beyond individual sources by showing patterns or gaps in knowledge."
  ],
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Which of these is a key difference between summary and synthesis?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "Summary is always longer than synthesis",
        "Synthesis combines ideas from multiple sources; summary focuses on one",
        "Summary uses citations, synthesis does not",
        "There is no difference"
      ],
      answer: "Synthesis combines ideas from multiple sources; summary focuses on one",
      explanation: "Synthesis is the higher-level skill of finding connections between different authors."
