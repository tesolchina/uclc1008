  title: "Effective Paraphrasing",
  examples: [],
  notes: [
    "Paraphrasing means expressing a borrowed idea using different words while preserving the original meaning.",
    "Strategies include: 1) Using synonyms, 2) Changing word forms (e.g., verb to noun), 3) Changing voice (active to passive), 4) Changing sentence patterns.",
    "Avoid 'patchwriting' – making minor changes that stay too close to the original structure.",
    "Always use proper in-text citations even when you have paraphrased in your own words.",
    "Gen-AI principles: The more effort you put into drafting, the less likely plagiarism will occur. AI is a tool, not an author."

  questions: [
    {
      question: "Which of the following is NOT a valid paraphrasing strategy?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "Using synonyms for key vocabulary",
        "Changing the word form (e.g., from 'analyze' to 'analysis')",
        "Copying the sentence and changing only the last word",
        "Changing the sentence from active to passive voice"
      ],
      answer: "Copying the sentence and changing only the last word",
      explanation: "Making only minor changes is considered patchwriting and can still lead to plagiarism."
