    "Common AWQ pitfalls: 1) Patchwriting (staying too close to the original), 2) Informal tone (e.g., using 'I think' or 'bad'), 3) Missing synthesis (summarizing articles separately instead of together).",
    "Accuracy (20%): Did you misinterpret any of the authors' findings?",
    "Synthesis (20%): Did your topic sentence connect ideas from both Article A and Article B?",
    "Paraphrasing (20%): Did you use your own words while maintaining the original meaning?",
    "Tone (20%): Was your language formal and objective?",
    "Citations (20%): Did you use correct APA 7th formats (e.g., Moon et al., 2020)?"
