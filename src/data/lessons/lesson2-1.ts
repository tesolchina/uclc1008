  notes: [
    "Academic papers are built on arguments. Topic sentences and concluding sentences are 'signposts' guiding you through the logic.",
    "A Purpose Statement expresses the central argument and is usually found at the end of the Introduction.",
    "A Topic Sentence contains the main idea of a single body paragraph. It should connect back to the purpose statement.",
    "When reading: Distinguish between authors' claims (supporting their stance) and opponents' claims (counterarguments).",
    "Distinguish evidence/data from claims. Data supports the claim but doesn't speak for the stance on its own."
