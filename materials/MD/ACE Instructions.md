## Your Task

1. **Revise the first draft of the position paper in response to the following topic:**

   > **Is working from home a worthwhile mode of work for employees?**

2. **You need to write a six-paragraph position paper of no more than 900 words, following this structure:**

   1. **Introduction:**  
      Set up the context and present your overall thesis, including your stance and a preview of two claims.
   
   2. **First Body Paragraph:**  
      Structure it using the Toulmin model’s three essential elements. It must contain:  
      - (a) a clear claim  
      - (b) evidence/data from the provided journal articles (grounds)  
      - (c) elaboration/explanation (warrant)
   
   3. **Second Body Paragraph:**  
      Focus exclusively on refuting the first claim. It must contain:  
      - (a) a counterargument  
      - (b) a response
   
   4. **Third Body Paragraph:**  
      Your second claim, following the same requirements as in (2) above.
   
   5. **Fourth Body Paragraph:**  
      Focus exclusively on refuting the second claim, following the same requirements as in (3) above.
   
   6. **Conclusion:**  
      Summarise your claims and restate your stance.

3. **You must use evidence from at least 3 of the given journal articles to support the arguments you present.**  
   The articles are available in the folder “Assignment Instructions - ACE” under “Argument Construction and Evaluation (Draft:15%, Final:25%)” on Moodle (Individual Section).

4. **Include in-text citations whenever necessary, and an end-of-text reference list at the end of the paper**  
   (Refer to pages 39-41 of Module 1 for relevant information).

5. **Academic Integrity and AI Usage**

   While the University encourages the ethical use of AI for learning (e.g. for brainstorming ideas, exploring information), submitting the output of generative AI tools as your own work in any assignment is deemed a violation of the University’s academic integrity guidelines.

   - If AI detection tools suggest that your assignment contains a high percentage of AI-generated text, you will be required to submit a detailed record of your use of such tools for the assessment in question. However, this record does not conclusively prove compliance.
   - Additionally, your instructor may also request an in-person oral or written defence, which will be recorded.
   - Failure to attend this mandatory defence will result in your assignment being graded solely on the submitted work, or a direct failure of this assignment, without any further opportunity for defence.
   - Students should understand that adhering to these guidelines is their responsibility and that violations may lead to serious academic consequences.
   - The Course Coordinator has the right to make the final decision on whether to apply a penalty and the extent of that penalty.

## 6. Reflection on AI Use in ACE Final (5%)

You are required to write a **250-300-word reflective report** evaluating your experience working with AI and critiquing AI-generated feedback. The report should justify the changes made (or not made) to your ACE final paper based on AI suggestions.

### Steps:

1. **Select an AI tool:**  
   Use one of the available tools on the HKBU GenAI Platform.

2. **Input Prompts:**  
   Refer to “1.3 Academic writing: AI prompts for refining the draft” (page 5) of the AI Workshop 2 handout (Moodle -> All Sections) for suggested prompts to refine your draft.

3. **Evaluate Critically:**  
   Assess each output or feedback using the ACE Final Checklist (page 1) of the AI Workshop 2 handout (Moodle -> All Sections). Do not accept AI suggestions blindly.

4. **In the report, you should:**
    - a. Justify why you accepted or rejected 2-3 AI suggestions.
    - b. Include original and revised versions of the sections where AI was used.
    - c. Attach the full chat history as an appendix (at the end of the report).

5. **Submit the report to Moodle by 5 Dec (6 p.m.).**

---

**Note:**  
You must retain the chat history from AI tools and your paper revision records as these may be requested by your teacher if there is suspicion that your work was copied directly from AI-generated content. Additionally, you may be required to attend an oral defence to verify the authenticity of their work.
