## Instructions

Students are required to submit a **500-word reflective report** evaluating AI suggestions in two or more of the following three skill areas:

- **Reading** (refer to AI Workshop 1, Part 4 or Workshop 2, Part 2)

- **Argumentation** (refer to Workshop 2, Part 2)

---

### Steps

1. **Select an AI tool:**  
   Use one of the available tools on the HKBU GenAI Platform.

2. **Choose 2 to 3 Focus Areas:**  
   Pick from the skills listed above.

3. **Input Prompts:**  
   Refer to the suggested prompts in the relevant workshop handouts.

4. **Evaluate Critically:**  
   Assess AI-generated output or feedback based on your own understanding of your learning needs. Do not accept it blindly.

5. **In the report, you should:**
    - **a. For Reading (if selected):**  
      Reflect on how the AI sharpened or weakened your reading skills (e.g., how to unpack complex ideas in a journal article).
    - **b. For Summarising/Paraphrasing & Argumentation:**  
      Compare your original work with AI-generated versions, and justify why you accepted or rejected the AI suggestions.
    - **c. Include both the original and revised versions of the sections where AI was used.**
    - **d. Attach the full chat history as an appendix (at the end of the report).**

6. **Submit the report to Moodle by 5 Dec (6 p.m.).**
