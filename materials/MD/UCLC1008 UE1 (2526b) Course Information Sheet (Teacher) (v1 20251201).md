## ASSESSMENT

Students’ progress will be evaluated through the following assessments/tests:

### Academic Writing Quiz (15%)  
**(CILOs 1, 2, 3) (In-class: 23-27 Feb)**

- Students will analyse academic texts to summarise, synthesise, and paraphrase key information, ensuring the use of academic tone and proper citations and references.

---

### Argument Construction and Evaluation (Draft) (15%)  
**(CILOs 1, 2, 3) (In-class: 16-20 Mar)**

- Based on academic articles provided, students will write a draft of 400-500 words, utilising a specific argumentation model to construct a detailed argument, a counterargument, and a rebuttal on a selected topic.
- The draft requires students to select ideas and supporting evidence from various sources, and then summarise, synthesise, and paraphrase them to form the argument.
- This assignment aims to familiarise students with various argumentation frameworks (e.g. the Toulmin Model, Rogerian Argument) through asking them to apply one model to construct a well-supported argument.

---

### Argument Construction and Evaluation (Final) (25%)  
**(CILOs 1, 2, 3, 5) (Due: 1 May)**

- **Final Paper (20%)**: Students will incorporate feedback from teachers, AI tools, and peers during the process of revision and extend the draft to approximately 800 words. The rewriting process engages students in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments, counterarguments, and rebuttals they read. It aims to help students construct a well-supported argument following a selected argumentation model clearly and persuasively.
- **Reflection on AI Use (5%)**: Students are required to reflect on the process of working with AI and critique AI-generated material, providing justification for the changes made in the final paper.

---

### Critical Response to Academic Arguments (20%)  
**(CILOs 1, 2, 4) (In-class: 20-24 Apr)**

- Students will listen to a short audio clip, which begins with background information of a topic, followed by an argument.
- Afterwards, students will be given time to prepare and present a verbal response in the form of a summary and a rebuttal of the argument they heard.

---

### Reflective Learning Portfolio (10%)  
**(CILO 5) (Due on 1 May - NO LATE submission)**

- Students will engage in a reflective analysis of two to three learning episodes during the process of using AI tools throughout the course.
- In the 500-word portfolio, students are required to critically compare their original work with AI-generated versions and explain the rationale behind the extent of adoption or rejection in their final submission.
- The portfolio must include a comprehensive record of interactions with AI tools, documenting dialogues, original drafts, revisions, and final versions.
- The goal of this assignment is to help students use AI as a learning partner to constantly reflect on the evolution of their work and to enhance their self-directed learning skills.

---

### Class Participation (15%)  
**(for CILOs 1, 2, 3, 4)**

- Students’ participation and involvement in in- and out-of-class activities (5%) (whole semester)
- Peer Evaluation on Argument Construction and Evaluation (Draft) (5%) (In-class: 13-17 Apr)
- Pre-course Writing (2.5%) (Due on 23 Jan, NO LATE submission)
- Referencing Quiz (2.5%) (Due on 30 Jan, NO LATE submission)

---

Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes. If absence is due to circumstances beyond their control, to apply for make-up work (e.g. papers, assignments), a written explanation together with supporting documents must be presented to the course instructor for approval within **FIVE calendar days after the absence** (e.g., your written explanation and the document should be submitted to the course instructor on or before Saturday if you are absent on Monday).

## Late Assignment Submissions

Late assignment submissions will incur a penalty — **one percent will be deducted for each day past the deadline** (weekends and statutory holidays included). For example, if your Argument Construction and Evaluation (Final) is initially awarded 17% (out of 20%) and is two days late, then the final score for this assignment will be:


17% - 2% = 15%


If you have a valid reason for late submission, you should discuss it with your lecturer **prior to the assignment due date**.

Students must take all assessment tests and submit all assignments. **MAKE-UP tests** will be allowed only upon presentation of a valid medical or official leave certificate **within FIVE calendar days from the test date**.  
*(e.g., the supporting document should be submitted to the course instructor on or before Saturday if the test is scheduled for Monday).*

---

## Plagiarism Policy

Plagiarism (i.e. copying from other sources without an acknowledgement or copying other students’ work) is **NOT tolerated at HKBU**. Should a case of plagiarism be established, University regulations will be strictly applied, and these potentially include failing a course or being expelled from the University. Please read the University’s guidelines for students on academic integrity.

Students should be reminded that they **cannot show, lend, give away or sell parts of their work to other students or/and work together with another student to jointly produce even a small part of an assignment**. If a case of plagiarism is established, **both parties will be punished**.

---

## Use of AI Tools in Assessments

While the University encourages the ethical use of AI for learning (e.g. for brainstorming ideas, exploring information), **submitting the output of generative AI tools as your own work in any assignment is deemed a violation of the University’s academic integrity guidelines**.

If AI detection tools suggest that your assignment contains a high percentage of AI-generated text, you will be required to submit a detailed record of your use of such tools for the assessment in question. However, this record does not conclusively prove compliance. Additionally, your instructor may also request an **in-person oral or written defence**, which will be recorded. Failure to attend this mandatory defence will result in your assignment being graded solely on the submitted work, or a direct failure of this assignment, without any further opportunity for defence.

Students should understand that adhering to these guidelines is their responsibility and that violations may lead to serious academic consequences. The Course Coordinator has the right to make the final decision on whether to apply a penalty and the extent of that penalty.

> **Please note:** Any texts submitted to generative AI platforms may be added to the internal databases of such platforms for unknown purposes, potentially infringing on data privacy of the authors of the submitted texts.

## COURSE AIMS & DESCRIPTIONS

This course aims to enhance students’ English language skills in critical reading, listening, academic writing, as well as speaking.

This course strengthens students’ ability to:

1. **Analyse academic discourse** by examining the rhetorical and linguistic features used in academic writing, and learn to formulate arguments using various argumentation models;
2. **Respond critically to ideas** through examining and evaluating evidence and arguments, while employing diverse argumentation models to strengthen their responses;
3. **Develop critical thinking, reading and writing skills**, and transfer them to crafting well-structured academic essays; and
4. **Use reflection and self-assessment** to become more independent and competent readers and writers, with an emphasis on the ability to evaluate good argument structures.

---

## COURSE INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES (CILOS)

Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:

1. **Examine academic discourse**, including how arguments are constructed using various models and their rhetorical purposes, pattern of development, and style;
2. **Evaluate arguments in academic texts**, as well as summarise and synthesise source materials by using appropriate academic conventions and specific citation and referencing styles (e.g. APA), and understand the rhetorical functions of citations;
3. **Construct well-supported and logical arguments** by engaging in the recursive process of reading, inventing, drafting, reviewing, reflecting, rewriting, revising, and editing;
4. **Formulate critical spoken responses** to arguments presented in audio texts, utilising various argumentation models to strengthen the responses; and
5. **Use AI, as a learning partner, and appropriate self-access multimedia resources** to foster independent learning in reading, listening, speaking and writing skills.
