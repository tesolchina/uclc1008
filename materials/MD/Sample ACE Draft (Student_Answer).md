Although facial recognition technology (FRT) is becoming more common in schools worldwide, this paper argues that it is not advisable for schools to adopt FRT on campus due to possible violation of students’ privacy.

FRT intrudes on students’ privacy since the “informed consent” is not observed (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020). For instance, the facial recognition systems in operation in schools scan all students' faces in classrooms and corridors to function regardless of whether or not a student has opted out (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020). In other words, even if students can choose to opt out, the system cannot avoid scanning everyone, making "opt-in" or "opt-out" options impractical. As a result, this violates the principle of “informed consent” because students are not allowed to choose not to participate (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).

Some opponents claim that even if facial recognition systems scan all students by default, an “opt-out” mechanism still allows them to later remove their data or disable tracking, thereby preserving the principle of informed consent. However, while “opt-out” may allow data removal after scanning, the initial collection still violates privacy, as students have no rights to avoid being scanned in the first place. In fact, true consent requires the ability to refuse participation entirely, not just after the initial scanning.

## 4. Warrant* (Bridge)

In other words, even if students can choose to opt out, the system cannot avoid scanning everyone, making "opt-in" or "opt-out" options impractical. As a result, this violates the principle of “informed consent” because students are not allowed to choose not to participate (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).

Facial recognition technology has been adopted by many schools all over the world. However, some parents do not support the FRT in schools due to the privacy issue.

Parents think FRT harms their kids a lot. The results of a research study indicate that the average score of parents’ dangerous beliefs in the virtual world (DBVW) is 3.865, which is higher than the average level (3.000), indicating that the parents were worried about the disclosure of students’ personal privacy, and generally had a cautious attitude towards new technologies (Perry & Sibley, 2010). FRT violates students’ privacy.

It is argued that FRT does not harm their kids because it monitors them 24/7, ensuring their safety in school. Although kids are monitored all the time, it can’t guarantee their safety.
