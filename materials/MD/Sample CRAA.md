## Critical Response to Academic Arguments (CRAA)  
**Sample Assessment Paper**  
**UCLC1008**  
**University English I (2025-26, S1)**

## Instructions

This assessment consists of three parts:

### 1. Listening (2 minutes)
- You will listen to an audio clip, which begins with background information of the topic, followed by one argument.
- You may take notes while listening.
- The clip will only be played once.

### 2. Preparation (2 minutes)
- You will have 2 minutes to organise your notes and summary.
- Use this time to develop your counterargument with evidence and explanations (logical reasoning) to challenge the argument presented in the audio clip.

### 3. Critical Response (2 minutes\*)
- Orally present your summary of the argument (i.e. claim, evidence and explanation) from the audio clip.
- Clearly state your counterargument with supporting evidence and explanations.
- Conclude by reiterating your main points.

Your response will be recorded for assessment purposes. Please state your **Name**, **Student ID Number**, and **Section Number** before you start giving your response.

---

> \* You are strongly advised to spend approximately 1 minute to present your summary and 1 minute to state your counterargument and the conclusion.

### Is lab-grown meat worth promoting in the future?

Offering a potential solution to the environmental impact of livestock farming (**Background - Context**), lab-grown meat, also known as cultured meat, is produced by cultivating animal cells in a controlled environment (**Background - Definition**). While lab-grown meat is increasingly available in supermarkets and restaurants, there is a growing debate about whether it should be promoted as a sustainable and cost-effective way to satisfy the global demand for meat (**Focus**). During a group discussion with her classmates, Grace supported the promotion of lab-grown meat in the future. Here’s what she said:

---

**[Grace’s claim]** Lab-grown meat is worth promoting as it has a lot of potential for customisation for different consumers (**Claim**). This technology allows consumers to tailor-make meat products for specific dietary needs or preferences (**Evidence - Example**). For example, current cultured meat research is looking at the use of specific flavour compounds, such as those mimicking grilled beef, which producers can use to modify the taste profile to meet diverse consumer preferences (**Evidence - Example**). This customisation can extend beyond just flavours. Similar techniques are being applied to adjust the fat content to address different dietary needs and preferences (**Explanation - Elaboration**). Ultimately, this level of customisation can cater to diverse consumers and offer healthier and more sustainable options that can appeal to a broader range of consumers (**Explanation - Reasoning**).

## Tom’s Summary and Counterargument

Lab-grown meat is a new food technology that grows animal cells in labs instead of farms. Some people think it’s good for the environment, but others don’t (**Context & Focus**). (**No Claim**). Personally, I think it’s acceptable because it’s natural (**Evidence - Example + Personal Opinion**). Also, you can use lab-grown meat to make different meat products for special dietary needs or special flavour like grilled beef. So, lab-grown meat is good and can attract more customers to try it in the future.

However, don’t forget it’s expensive. Poor people can’t afford it (**Additional Information Absent in Original**).

Although lab-grown meat is nice and can attract many customers, experts say it might cause cancer (**Counterargument, not addressing the claim as it is absent**). This is scary because people could get sick because of the meat (**Explanation - Reasoning, but unclear**). Another problem is that companies lie about how ‘green’ it is (**Evidence - Example, unsubstantiated**). They said lab-grown meat is ‘green’ and can protect the environment, but in fact there is no evidence to prove (**Evidence - Elaboration, vague**). So, it might actually hurt the planet (**Explanation - Reasoning, but weak**).

## Jacky’s Summary and Counterargument

The extract discusses lab-grown meat, which is made by growing animal cells in labs, to reduce the environmental impact of livestock farming (**Context & Focus**). The speaker argues that lab-grown meat should be promoted because it can be customised to suit different consumer needs (**Claim**). For example, producers can adjust flavours and fat content to match preferences (**Evidence - Example**). As a result, this flexibility could make lab-grown meat more appealing to a wider consumer base, making it a more sustainable and healthier food choice (**Explanation - Reasoning**).

While lab-grown meat offers customisation benefits, it may not be as sustainable and healthy as claimed (**Counterargument**). Studies show that current production methods require significant energy inputs (**Evidence - Example**). For example, lab-grown meat generates 25-30% more carbon emissions than poultry farming (**Evidence - Data**). This is because maintaining germ-free lab conditions and the nutrients for cell growth requires a lot of electricity, which often comes from non-renewable energy sources (**Explanation - Reasoning**). Additionally, the long-term health effects remain uncertain since the use of growth factors to stimulate cell multiplication may have unforeseen consequences (**Explanation - Reasoning**). Therefore, lab-grown meat may not be as sustainable and healthy as it’s portrayed to be (**Explanation - Reasoning**).

## Summarisation Techniques Used

1. **Paraphrasing**  
   - Original:  
     > "lab-grown meat, also known as cultured meat, is produced by cultivating animal cells in a controlled environment."
   - Summary:  
     > "…(which) is made by growing animal cells in labs…"
   - *Simplifies technical phrasing while keeping the core meaning.*

2. **Generalisation**  
   - Original:  
     > "…current cultured meat research is looking at the use of specific flavour compounds…"
   - Summary:  
     > "…producers can adjust flavours…"
   - *Broadens the example to cover the main idea without technical details.*

3. **Omission**  
   - Excludes "grilled beef" and "specific dietary needs"
   - *Focuses on the key claim (customisation) rather than minor details.*

4. **Restructuring**  
   - Combines Background, Context and Focus into one sentence.
