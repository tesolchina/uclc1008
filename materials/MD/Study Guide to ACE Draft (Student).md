## Study Guide to Argument Construction & Evaluation (ACE) - Draft  
**UCLC1008**  
**University English I (2025-26, S1)**

---

The Argument Construction and Evaluation (ACE) Draft assignment requires you to write a three-paragraph essay (“Position Paper”), following this structure:

1. **Introduction:** Set up the context and present your overall thesis (thesis statement).
2. **First Body Paragraph:** Structure it using the Toulmin model’s three essential elements. It must contain:
    - A clear claim
    - Evidence/data from the provided excerpts (grounds)
    - An elaboration/explanation (warrant)
3. **Second Body Paragraph:** Focus exclusively on refuting an opposing viewpoint. It must contain:
    - A counterargument
    - A response

This study guide aims to provide you with the language input for each of these elements.

## 1. How to Write a Strong Thesis Statement?

A thesis statement shows the central argument of your paper, which usually appears at the end of the introduction. A strong thesis statement has the following features:

- **Specific:** State your position (argument) precisely
- **Arguable:** Present an arguable statement rather than a fact
- **Focused:** Include a preview of the major claims in the body paragraphs that follow
- **Relevant:** Address the topic or question of the paper

### Example 1

**Topic:** Are chatbots suitable companions for young people?

> Although chatbots may seem like helpful companions, this paper argues that they are not suitable for young people because they fail to provide true companionship, instead intensifying loneliness and fostering a false sense of reality.

The thesis statement above is strong because it clearly introduces the two claims: “they intensify feelings of loneliness” and “create a false sense of reality” to illustrate why chatbots fail to provide true companionship to support the argument “(chatbots) are not suitable for young people”.

## 2. How to Write an Effective Topic Sentence?

A topic sentence introduces the main idea of a paragraph and supports the thesis. It appears at the beginning of a body paragraph. An effective topic sentence has the following features:

- **Direct:** State the claim of the paragraph in one sentence.
- **Transitional:** Connect with the previous paragraph (if applicable).

### Example

> Chatbots give young people a false sense of reality.

In the above example, the reader will expect the writer to provide relevant examples of the limitations, and explain why they contribute to giving young people a false sense of reality. If the writer wants to connect this paragraph with the previous one, which discusses why chatbots intensify loneliness, the topic sentence can be re-written like this:

> Apart from intensifying loneliness, chatbots give young people a false sense of reality.

Other connecting phrases include:

- **Beyond intensifying loneliness, chatbots give young people a false sense of reality.**
- **Not only do chatbots intensify loneliness, but they also give young people a false sense of reality.**

## Practice

Rewrite the thesis statement and the topic sentence of the following Sample ACE (Draft) – Student B:

**Topic:** Is it advisable for schools to adopt facial recognition technologies (FRT) on campus?

Facial recognition technology has been adopted by many schools all over the world. However, some parents do not support the FRT in schools due to the privacy issue.

Parents think FRT harms their kids a lot. The results of a research study indicate that the average score of parents’ dangerous beliefs in the virtual world (DBVW) is 3.865, which is higher than the average level (3.000), indicating that the parents were worried about the disclosure of students’ personal privacy, and generally had a cautious attitude towards new technologies (Perry & Sibley, 2010).

> FRT violates students’ privacy.

It is argued that FRT does not harm their kids because it monitors them 24/7, ensuring their safety in school.

> Although kids are monitored all the time, it can’t guarantee their safety.
```

## 3. How to Connect a Counterargument and a Response?

**Example:**

> Some argue that chatbots do not deceive users but rather provide a safe, simulated environment for young people to practise social interactions and build confidence to carry over into their real-world relationships. It is worth pointing out that this view assumes that users will naturally outgrow chatbot dependence. Unfortunately, in reality, many young people, once accustomed to the simplicity of AI interactions, may avoid the complexities of human relationships altogether. Chatbots may replace real relationships, encouraging users to avoid human interaction and misunderstand true social connection.

To logically connect the response to the counterargument, ensure both of them argue on the same ‘ground’ (i.e., they are disputing the same central idea). Additionally, use signposting phrases like the following to signal concessions, as well as transitions from the Claim to Counterargument, and Counterargument to Response:

---

### Other Expressions for Counterarguments

- While some people hold the view that…
- Although some opponents claim/believe that…
- Proponents argue that …

### Other Expressions for Responses

- Nonetheless, others assert...
- In fact, the real situation is that …  
  (The “Yes, But …” approach)
- However, research studies show that…  
  (evidence-based)
- This claim assumes …but it fails to address…  
  (logical flaw)
- The claim that (chatbots provide a safe environment to young people) is irrelevant because…  
  (questioning relevance)
- Even if… it overlooks…  
  (highlighting incompleteness or weakness)
```
