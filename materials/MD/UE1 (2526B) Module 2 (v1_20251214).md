## Part 1 – Paraphrasing Skills

**Purpose of this Section:**  
To help students learn and practise paraphrasing skills

---

### Activity 1.1: Warm-up

Facial recognition technology is now becoming commonplace, from security checks to unlocking your phone. The technology provides a fast and accurate way of identity verification. Watch this video, and write a sentence summarising the talk.

## PARAPHRASING IN ACADEMIC WRITING

In academic writing, students often need to report ideas that are borrowed from existing sources. However, you must never directly copy ideas from other people’s work (even if it is only a short sentence or some phrases) and treat them as if they were written by you. This will be considered **plagiarism** and offenders could face serious disciplinary consequences. In addition to using proper in-text citations, you must **paraphrase** borrowed ideas in a way that is distinctly yours.

---

### What is paraphrasing?

Paraphrasing means expressing a borrowed idea (usually by someone else) using different words while preserving the original meaning.

In addition to avoiding plagiarism, paraphrasing borrowed ideas can also foster deeper understanding of the ideas, help you develop a personal voice, as well as ensure that the ideas are meaningfully used in a particular context.

---

## STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVE PARAPHRASING

You can use a combination of the following strategies for paraphrasing. Here are some examples:

### Using Synonyms for Vocabulary and Expressions

- **Large**  ⇄ major, big, sizable
- **Recognition** ⇄ detection, identification

### Changing the Word Form

- **Affect** (verb)  ⇄ effect, effectiveness (noun)  ⇄ effectively (adverb)
- **Motivate** (verb)  ⇄ motivation (noun)  ⇄ motivational (adjective)

## Changing the Voice (Active to Passive Voice)

- The researcher reviewed the existing literature  
  ↔️  Current literature was reviewed by the researcher.

---

## Changing Sentence Patterns

### Breaking a Complex Sentence into Two Simpler Ones

- Although the experiment yielded interesting results, further research is needed to confirm the findings.  
  ↔️  The experiment produced interesting results. However, more research studies are required to validate the results.

### Combining Simple Sentences into a More Complex One

- The company has started using facial recognition. It wanted to reduce the administrative cost.  
  ↔️  With an aim to lower administrative costs, the company has adopted the use of facial recognition.

## Activity 1.2: Avoiding Plagiarism when Paraphrasing

As you have learned in Module 1, plagiarism is the presentation of words, ideas or work created by other people as work of your own without proper acknowledgement or the original author’s consent. Plagiarism is a serious academic offence, and students must cite the work they use. When paraphrasing, students might commit plagiarism if they are not careful. Complete the following task to check your understanding.

---

### Read the text below and decide whether the following cases constitute plagiarism. Explain your choice.

> “Tellingly, these applications are beginning to shift from detection technology to identification technology as commercial outlets strive to link camera data with purchasing information. When facial recognition systems become widespread, detection applications (such as ‘mood’ inference) will also be implemented for purposes including marketing and security.”  
> *(Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2019, pp. 116-117.)*

---

#### Version 1

> Commercial outlets are shifting from using detection technology to identification technology for applications such as marketing and security (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2019).

---

#### Version 2

> Private enterprises are now focusing on using identification technology to facilitate better collection of purchasing data, such as customers’ mood, for adjusting their marketing strategies.

---

#### Version 3

> Andrejevic and Selwyn (2019) pointed out that there is a shift in direction regarding the commercialisation of identification technology as the facial recognition system gains more traction, with marketing and security being the focus of commercial interest.

## Activity 1.3: Practising Paraphrasing Strategies

Now, to practise using these strategies, partly change/rewrite the following phrases/sentences in **bold** based on the instructions given.

---

### Strategies

| Strategy | Example Quotes | Your Answers |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Using Synonyms for Vocabulary and Expressions** | 1. “Contemporary biometric facial recognition is a digitalised extension of facial mapping, utilising an algorithm to undertake the comparison.” (Smith & Miller, 2021, p.22) <br> 2. “These developments can be traced back to the introduction of biometric passports in the early 2000s.” (Smith & Miller, 2021, p.23) |  |
| **Changing the Word Form** | “Biometric facial recognition systems could assist in multiple ways to enhance security in each of these senses.” (Smith & Miller, 2021, p.33) |  |
| **Changing the Voice (passive to active voice)** | “Biometric facial recognition is widely used by the government and private sector.” (Smith & Miller, 2021, p.35) |  |
| **Breaking a complex sentence into two simpler ones** | “Facial recognition does not have the same degree of accuracy as fingerprint or DNA identification, and the frequency that facial features occur in the general population is unknown.” (Smith et al., 2018, as cited in Smith & Miller, 2021, p.22). |  |

## GIVING DEFINITIONS

When providing definitions, although it is possible for students to directly quote an existing source with the author’s last name, year of publication, and page number, it is generally preferred that students paraphrase and rewrite the definition in their own words. Take a look at the example below:

**Example:**  
> “‘Biometric identification’ is broadly defined as the automatic identification of individuals by their physiological or behavioural characteristics” (Iquii, 2018, as cited in Caines, 2021, p.29).

**Paraphrased definition:**  
> Generally speaking, “biometric identification” refers to technologies that automatically recognise individuals’ identity based on their behavioural and physiological features (Iquii, 2018, as cited in Caines, 2021, p.29).

By changing words like “broadly” to “generally”, “identification” to “recognise … identity”, the paraphrased sentence reflects a personal understanding while retaining the original meaning.

## Activity 1.4: Paraphrasing Exercise

Referring to the excerpts taken from Caines (2021) below, write your paraphrased version in the space provided. After you have completed the task, discuss your answers with a classmate. Do you notice any difference in understanding/meaning and ways of expression between you and your peer/classmate?

---

### Excerpts (Caines, 2021)

| Excerpt | Paraphrased Version |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 1. “Biometric identification” is broadly defined as the automatic identification of individuals by their physiological or behavioural characteristics” (Iquii, 2018, as cited in Caines, 2021. p.29). |  |
| 2. “Implementing a biometric identification system, however, requires consideration of several factors, such as price, maintenance cost, technical proficiency required to interpret results, and adoption level.” (Caines, 2021, p.29) |  |

### Paraphrased Version

3. “Scraping (machine-automated web browsing that enables access and recording) violates most websites’ terms of service (Rosebrock, 2020, as cited in Caines, 2021); however, the practice is generally legal, perhaps due in part to a lack of understanding and awareness [of scraping]” (Caines, 2021, p.32)

4. “It has been argued that those who are disadvantaged due to poverty, race, religion, ethnicity, and immigration status bear a disproportionately negative effect when being surveilled.” (Gellman & Adler-Bell, 2019, as cited in Caines, 2021, p.33)

## Part 2 – Summarising Skills

### Purpose of this Section

To help students learn and practise how to extract key information from academic articles for academic writing.

---

## WHAT IS SUMMARISING?

Summarising involves condensing a text to its main ideas (e.g. claims/arguments) and key points (e.g. evidence) while omitting unnecessary details, including detailed examples, data, methodology, findings in the form of numbers, statistical analyses and figures.

It is essential for effective comprehension, note-taking, and academic writing, allowing students to distil information and present it concisely.

---

## STEPS TO SUMMARISING

1. **Read Thoroughly:**  
   Understand the original text's content, structure, and main ideas.

2. **Identify Key Points:**  
   Highlight or note down the main ideas and arguments and distinguish them from supporting details.

3. **Eliminate Extraneous Information:**  
   Remove supporting details such as detailed examples, data, methodology, findings in the form of numbers, statistical analyses, anecdotes, and non-essential information that do not contribute to the core message.

4. **Use Your Own Words:**  
   Rewrite the main points in your own language to ensure accurate understanding and avoid plagiarism.

---

> **Aim for a summary that is significantly shorter than the original text (e.g. 1/3 of the original length).**

---

## Maintain the Original Tone

Preserve the author’s intent and tone in your summary.

---

## Activity 2.1: Learn Summarising Skill through Reading Abstracts

A typical example which can showcase the use of summarising skills in academic writing is the use of academic journal article abstracts. Read the following abstract from a journal article about facial recognition technology and discuss the following questions with your peers in class.

---

### ARTICLE 1: SENG ET AL. (2021)

> “Facial recognition (FR) technology is being adopted in both private and public spheres for a wide range of reasons, from ensuring physical safety to providing personalised shopping experiences. It is not clear yet, though, how users perceive this emerging technology in terms of usefulness, risks, and comfort. We begin to address these questions in this paper.  
> In particular, we conducted a vignette-based study with 314 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to investigate their perceptions of facial recognition in the physical world, based on thirty-five scenarios across eight different contexts of FR use. We found that users do not have a binary answer towards FR adoption. Rather, their perceptions are grounded in the specific contexts in which FR will be applied. The participants considered a broad range of factors, including control over facial data, the utility of FR, the trustworthiness of organisations using FR, and the location and surroundings of FR use to place the corresponding privacy risks in context. They weighed the privacy risks with the usability, security, and economic gain of FR use as they reported their perceptions. Participants also noted the reasons and rationales behind their perceptions of facial recognition, which let us conduct an in-depth analysis of their perceived benefits, concerns, and comfort with using this technology in various scenarios. Through this first systematic look into users’ perceptions of facial recognition in the physical world, we shed light on the tension between FR adoption and users’ concerns. Taken together, our findings have broad implications that advance the Privacy and Security community’s understanding of FR through the lens of users, where we present guidelines for future research in these directions.”

## Discussion Questions

1. What did the authors focus on when writing the article's abstract?
2. What writing techniques did the authors use in their abstract?

---

## STEPS TO FOLLOW WHEN SUMMARISING AN ARTICLE

To help you understand the process of summarising ideas, here are 4 steps that you can follow when writing an article summary (adapted from McCombes, 2025).

### 1. Read the text

Quickly skim through the article/text to gain a basic understanding, and then read the article/text thoroughly and take notes of important points (e.g. claims/arguments, evidence, implications, conclusion).

### 2. Focus on the sections that interest you the most

Pay attention to section headings and label important ones. Focus on sections that mention points/content that could be valuable to your work.

### 3. Identify key elements in the relevant sections

After carefully reading the focussed section, highlight the most essential words and sentences ONLY. It is important to exclude supplementary information and excessive details (e.g. detailed methodology, findings, statistical analyses, figures) from the summary.

### 4. Write the summary

Paraphrase the ideas and reorganise them into a short, coherent paragraph. Here are some questions that your readers might want to know when reading your summary of an empirical journal article:

- What question or problem was addressed?

- What were the most important/significant findings?
- What are the implications of the results?

---

## Academic Integrity Note

Directly copying and pasting sentences from an article is **NOT** an appropriate way of summarising ideas and could constitute plagiarism. Always ensure that you use your own words (paraphrasing) and cite the sources of the ideas used following the APA 7th edition guidelines.

---

## Examples of Summarising

The main ideas of an article may include the author’s stance, arguments/claims, benefits, drawbacks, risks, problems, solutions, etc. Here are some examples of summarising. Pay attention to how the words are paraphrased and how the main ideas are extracted.

---

### Example 1

> “The use of facial recognition technology (FRT) has continued to grow and expand, providing helpful and creative uses in almost all aspects of life. The expansive use of the technology in social media, in particular, has begun to facilitate conversation amongst not only lawmakers, but everyday citizens as well. Although fairly new and exciting to some, facial recognition technology has become increasingly worrisome for many, in part due to the lack of regulations surrounding the technology. As facial recognition technology evolves and expands, there is an increasing need for regulation at the federal level. These regulations should consider and incorporate language that will allow the technology to continue providing benefits to society, but also ensure that limitations and penalties are placed on users of the technology to protect citizens.”  
> *(McClellan, 2020, p.364)*

---

#### How to Extract Key Points from Example 1

- In Example 1, the first sentence highlights the **benefits** of FRT in many areas of life.
- Meanwhile, sentence 3 indicates that FRT poses some **risks** brought by the lack of regulations governing its use.
- Lastly, sentences 4 and 5 conclude that **regulations are required to protect citizens**.

These key points can be summarised into the following:

---

**Example 1 – Summarised Text:**

> McClellan (2020) argues that despite the benefits of facial recognition technology in many areas of life, legal regulations need to be implemented to safeguard citizens’ rights and address public concerns.


---

**UCLC1008 UE1 (2025-26, S2) (v1_20251215)**  
© 2025 Language Centre - HKBU

---

## EXAMPLE 2

> Although the regulations and policies of private companies appear to protect users’ privacy, most companies default to an “opt-in” method, and users must proactively seek to “opt out” of their data usage. Each policy also seemingly includes language that appears to ensure users’ data is “safe,” but then speaks in overbroad terms and fails to define important words and phrases, such as “metadata.” It is also concerning that privacy policies, such as that of Shutterfly’s, now protects the privacy of California consumers differently than it protects the privacy of other consumers. The lack of consistency and clarity for users further illustrates the importance and need for federal regulations surrounding facial recognition technology.”  
> *(McClellan, 2020, p.371)*

---

## How to extract key points from Example 2

- **Sentences 1 and 2** suggest that there are problems with the regulations of companies that adopt FRT.
- **Sentence 3** is a specific example, so it does not need to be summarised.
- **Sentences 2 and 4** further explain what the problems are, and **Sentence 4** indicates that because of these problems, federal (i.e. government) regulations are needed (i.e. a solution).

---

These key points can be summarised into the following.

### Example 2 – Summarised text

> According to McClellan (2020), while some private companies’ facial recognition policies claim to protect users’ privacy and personal data, the terms and definitions that they utilise are vague, inconsistent, and sometimes missing, necessitating stricter government regulations.

## Activity 2.2: Summarising Arguments from an Article

Following the steps mentioned above, identify the main argument/claim and write a summary for each argument/claim taken from the article by Seng et al. (2021).

---

### Original Texts

> “… individual privacy often needs to be sacrificed for the greater good, such as for public safety. This argument is in line with Himma’s argument on social contract theory, which states that being a part of a society, the citizen must submit to the state for national security (Moore, 2010; 2015). The participants understand the importance of physical safety, where they referred to a series of past incidents of bombings and physical harm in public gatherings or on airplanes. These past events influenced participants’ opinion to adopt FR for tracking in public space or identifying passengers during boarding a flight to provide for more safety and security. However, poor experiences with airport security made several participants sceptical about gaining significant safety and security benefits from FR.”  
> *(Seng et al., 2021, p. 14)*

---

### Summary

1. Seng et al. (2021) argue that individual privacy may need to be compromised for public safety, referencing social contract theory. While past security incidents have led some participants to support facial recognition (FR) for increased safety, negative experiences with airport security have caused others to doubt its effectiveness.

## Original Texts

### Summary

2.  
> “Facial recognition (FR) has experienced a sharp improvement in recent years due to improvements in both hardware and algorithms (Materese, 2018; Phillips et al., 2018). The failure rate in facial recognition has decreased from 5% to 0.2% over the last eight years (2010 to 2018) (Materese, 2018), and in several instances, FR has been found more effective than manual efforts to successfully recognise a human face (Lu & Tang, 2015).”  
> *(Seng et al., 2021, p. 2)*

3.  
> “Participants reported their lack of control and trust in FR-based authentication, where they are afraid that such technology would mistakenly authenticate adversaries allowing them access to valuable information and belongings. This lack of trust in efficacy is also one of the reasons why participants see a limited benefit in using FR to get personalised offers.”  
> *(Seng et al., 2021, p. 13)*

| Original Text | A Student’s Summary | Problem and Rewritten Sentence(s) |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| “Proponents of facial recognition (and surveillance technology in general) usually counter criticism of compulsory scanning with arguments along the lines of ‘if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear’. While questionable in any context, this argument overlooks the value for some students to have an opportunity to hide while in school. Indeed, the constant surveillance of campus facial recognition equates with a substantial curtailment in students’ right to obscurity while in school. In short, students will find it increasingly difficult to blend into the background, take a back seat, and generally go about their business ‘under the radar’.” (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020, p. 122) | Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) argued that students will find it difficult to blend into the background. |  |

## Original Text

> “Countries such as the US, UK and Australia are now seeing facial recognition technologies being installed and operated in a number of different types of (quasi)public space – including factories, cafes, airports, shopping areas, and government buildings. More often than not, the underlying aim of such systems is to identify and/or recognise people and track their movements. The specific applications of this technology are diverse. For example, retail providers are working on the development of pay-by-face technology. In other sectors, facial recognition technology is already being used by cafes to identify repeat customers and their regular orders (Bolger 2018). Workplaces are adopting facial recognition to allow employees to clock in and out, while airports are screening travellers by matching face scans to online images, watch lists, criminal databases and social media (Burt 2018). Perhaps most contentiously, cameras equipped with facial recognition technology are now being used by law enforcement agencies to identify criminals and search for missing persons (Grubb 2018).”  
> *(Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020, p. 116)*

---

## A Student’s Summary

According to Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020), facial recognition technologies have been implemented in countries including the US, UK and Australia, and in places such as factories, cafes, airports, shopping areas and government buildings, namely for purposes such as pay-by-face technology, analysing customers' preferences, workplace management, airport security and crime prevention.

## Original Text

> “In particular, we conducted a vignette-based study with 314 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to investigate their perceptions of facial recognition in the physical world, based on thirty-five scenarios across eight different contexts of FR use. We found that users do not have a binary answer towards FR adoption. Rather, their perceptions are grounded in the specific contexts in which FR will be applied. The participants considered a broad range of factors, including control over facial data, the utility of FR, the trustworthiness of organisations using FR, and the location and surroundings of FR use to place the corresponding privacy risks in context.”

## Part 3 – Synthesising Skills

### Purpose of this Section

To help students learn and practise synthesising skills for grouping or comparing and contrasting different sources in an argument.

---

## WHAT IS SYNTHESISING?

Synthesising entails meaningfully interweaving ideas from two or more sources to form a cohesive argument or narrative. When synthesising different ideas, it is essential to present a clear logical flow by ensuring that they complement or contrast with one another effectively.

Synthesis words — such as **"similarly," "on the other hand,"** or **"in contrast"** — are typically used to highlight relationships between different concepts. As always, proper in-text citations must be used at all times, as they provide the necessary attribution to the original authors, lending credibility to your synthesis and supporting your overall argument.

---

## Examples of Synthesising

### Combining similar ideas from two sources:

- Facial recognition systems are now being developed as a means of ensuring the integrity of various aspects of online courses. This includes controlling access to online educational content (Montgomery & Marais, 2014, as cited in Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020), as well as using webcam-based facial recognition to authenticate online learners (i.e., confirming that the people engaging in online learning activities are actually the persons they claim to be) (Valera et al., 2015, as cited in Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).

  > The two similar ideas given above support the highlighted topic sentence. The two similar ideas are connected using ‘as well as’ with in-text citations added to each.

- Companies such as Apple have begun using multifactor biometrics and facial recognition technology as a method to unlock phones (Apple, 2020, as cited in McClellan, 2020). **Similarly**, companies such as Google have developed technology that is able to recognise a user’s voice, such that its Google Home responses may be

Tailored to the specific user, or may not respond at all to users who it does not recognise (Larson, 2017, as cited in McClellan, 2020).

The two similar ideas are that different companies are using facial recognition technology in various ways and the ideas are connected using ‘Similarly’ with in-text citations added to each.

---

## Combining Contrasting Ideas from Two Sources

- In a study by Seng et al. (2021), it was found that participants are open to giving up some of their individual privacy in exchange for public security, citing cases such as terrorist attacks in public gatherings. This shows that when the perceived benefit is obvious, some level of compromise of individual privacy could be seen as acceptable.
- However, in the context of campus facial recognition, Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) argue that the danger of taking away students' privacy through FR outweighs its benefits. This is because as children and adolescents develop their social identities, having privacy in schools can provide them with the autonomy to handle problems on their own.

In the above, Seng et al. (2021) believe that sacrificing individual privacy for the sake of public security is needed on certain occasions, but Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) argue that students’ privacy should be protected on school campuses. These two contrasting ideas are combined into one paragraph and the ideas are contrasted using ‘However’ with in-text citations added to each.

## Integration of Different Sources (at least two) in an Information-Prominent Citation

(Two sources mention similar ideas, so the two sources are placed together at the end of the sentence):

- “The first reported use of FR dated back to the 1960s, when Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe developed the RAND tablet, which could be used to manually record the coordinate locations of various facial features, including the eyes, nose, and hairline (Ballantyne et al., 1996; Gates, 2004, as cited in Seng et al., 2021, p.2).”

- “Similarly, there is a growing interest in using facial recognition technology for so-called e-assessment security – i.e., verifying the identity of students taking computer-based tests and examinations, and confirming their continued presence during the whole examination period (Apampa et al., 2010; Hernández et al., 2008, as cited in Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020, p.119).”

## Activity 3.1: Identifying Instances of Synthesis

Read the excerpts below and in groups, highlight or indicate instances of synthesis. Classify each instance as follows:

- **Agreement in literature**
- **Contrast in literature**
- **Transition showing agreement**
- **Transition showing disagreement** (e.g. while, whereas, however, etc.)
- **Integration of two or more sources**

### Excerpt from Seng et al. (2021, pp. 2-3)

> “FR is used in a wide range of scenarios at present and the presence of FR is becoming nearly ubiquitous, with more devices that we interact with every day are becoming smart. For example, it is used to unlock personal devices (Chmielewski, 2015; Finnegan & Kapo, 2018; Tengyuen, 2017) and physical space (Karantzoulidis, 2019; Wollerton, 2019); for in-person/on-site (France-Presse, 2019; Kwan, 2019; Peter et al., 2011) and online financial transactions (Kan, 2015; Knight, 2017; Petroff, 2016); for identification at the customer service of financial and non-financial organisations (Davis West, 2019; Mejia, 2019; Wang, 2018); to provide personalised services, special offers, or advertisements in the retail store, restaurant, library, and gas station (Association, 2013; Bates, 2017; Pearson, 2018; Romero, 2019); for tracking people at a retail store or public gathering (Bates, 2017; Brant, 2017; Davis West, 2018; Wolfe-Robinson, 2019); while boarding a flight (Oliver, 2019; Wallace, 2018); and to record students’ class attendance (Toor, 2017).”

As a result, there is growing discussion in the media about the use of FR in everyday life. Recent news indicates that people are in favour of using FR when retailers have to prevent shoplifting (Davis West, 2018) or to help a celebrity identify her stalkers (Castro, 2019). On the other hand, there are concerns about the use of FR, including its biased accuracy. For example, the evaluation of three commercial gender classification systems indicate that darker-skinned females are the most mis-classified group, with error rates of up to 34.7%, while the maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8% (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018).

There are also other security and privacy risks involved with the use of FR (Prabhakar et al., 2003; Venkatraman & Delpachitra, 2008; Zhang et al., 2015). Recently, 27.8 million biometric records were leaked by Biostar (Baraniuk, 2019), where the exposed information included users’ fingerprints and facial recognition data that were used to access protected buildings. While many FR systems store templates – condensed representations of facial data rather than full facial images – there are several ways to conduct an attack by exploiting a stolen template (Jain et al., 2005). Worse still, biometric templates are unchangeable and cannot be reissued in the same manner as passwords if compromised (Jain et al., 2008). Thus, the widespread reliance on FR as a primary authenticator could pose significant security risks (Mehmood & Selwal, 2020; Nandakumar & Jain, 2015).

#### 3.

> “Recent news indicates that people are in favour of using FR when retailers have to prevent shoplifting (Davis West, 2018) or to help a celebrity identify her stalkers (Castro, 2019)” (as cited in Seng et al., 2021, p.2).

> “Although facial recognition technology provides benefits in the criminal justice system, federal regulations must support these benefits while ensuring the privacy of citizens and guaranteeing safety from ‘unreasonable searches and seizures’ of the government.” (McClellan, 2020, p.377).

**(Synthesising)**  
Previous studies found that people are mostly in favour of using facial recognition for stopping crimes (Seng et al., 2021). On the other hand, McClellan (2020) stressed that regulations protecting citizens’ privacy must be in place.

#### 4.

> “Internationally, facial recognition technology has been used to prevent distracted driving” (McClellan, 2020, p.371).

> “However, poor experiences with airport security made several participants sceptical about gaining significant safety and security benefits from FR” (Seng et al., 2021, p.14).

**(Synthesising)**  
According to McClellan (2020), facial recognition can help reduce distracted driving. Seng et al. (2021) argued that people’s bad personal experience could lead to scepticism towards the technology.

## Generative AI Statement

Part of the materials in this unit were generated using generative AI tools following HKBU guidelines. Uses of generative AI will be noted, indicating the tool(s), models, and original prompts used.

---

## Use of AI Tools in Assessments in UE1

While the University encourages the ethical use of AI for learning (e.g., for brainstorming ideas, exploring information), submitting the output of generative AI tools as your own work in any assignment is deemed a violation of the University’s academic integrity guidelines.

If AI detection tools suggest that your assignment contains a high percentage of AI-generated text, you will be required to submit a detailed record of your use of such tools for the assessment in question. However, this record does not conclusively prove compliance.

Additionally, your instructor may also request an in-person oral or written defence, which will be recorded. Failure to attend this mandatory defence will result in your assignment being graded solely on the submitted work, or a direct failure of this assignment, without any further opportunity for defence.

Students should understand that adhering to these guidelines is their responsibility and that violations may lead to serious academic consequences. The Course Coordinator has the right to make the final decision on whether to apply a penalty and the extent of that penalty.

---

Students should write their assignments, paraphrase and synthesise authors' ideas on their own, and avoid asking ChatGPT or other GenAI tools for paraphrases or syntheses, as this may lead to plagiarism and raise ethical concerns (e.g., the data may be used by ChatGPT for other purposes). Additionally, information generated by GenAI may be distorted in meaning, lack context, lack a personal voice, and include inaccurate citations.

## Uses and Limitations of Gen AI for Academic Writing

Generative AI can be a powerful tool for assisting you in academic writing and helping you practise fundamental skills such as summarising, paraphrasing, and synthesising. However, using generative AI comes with a number of risks and could have negative effects on your learning.

In groups, debate on the topic:  
**“Should students be allowed to use Gen AI for academic writing? If yes, when?”**  

As you discuss, address the following questions:

1. **Have you ever used GenAI tools for paraphrasing, summarising, or synthesising?**  
   If you have, what do you think are the main advantages and disadvantages of using them?

2. **What do you believe are the ethical boundaries for using AI tools in academic writing?**  
   How do you determine what is acceptable and what might compromise your work's integrity?

---

As students, you may find that GenAI tools offer several benefits when it comes to summarising and synthesising texts. One of the primary advantages is **speed**; GenAI can quickly generate summaries of large volumes of text, making the process much more efficient for your studies. Additionally, these tools provide **consistency**, ensuring uniformity in summarisation and synthesis across different texts, which can help you maintain a consistent style or tone in your work. Furthermore, GenAI tools enhance **accessibility**, as they can assist students with varying levels of language proficiency, allowing everyone to engage with complex materials more effectively.

---

### GenAI’s Limitation in Generating a Summary/Synthesis

- GenAI-generated summaries/syntheses may omit crucial information necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the topic.
- There is also a risk of hallucinations, where the AI generates false information or makes up details that are not present in the original text.

---

Understanding these challenges is essential for effectively integrating AI into your academic writing process. By recognising the limitations of GenAI, you can harness its benefits while ensuring that your work maintains the highest standards of academic integrity.

As previously mentioned, it is important to be aware of the limitations of relying on GenAI for summarisation and syntheses. One significant drawback is that AI may overlook nuances and context, leading to incomplete or inaccurate summaries that fail to capture the original text's intended meaning. Moreover, depending too much on AI can hinder your development of summarising and synthesising skills. When you rely solely on AI for this task, you might

## Using Effective Prompts

When using GenAI, the quality of output can be affected by the instructions given (prompts). Let us take a look at the following examples. In this scenario, a student wants GenAI to help him/her write a summary paragraph for an article. Which prompt do you think is better? Try them out with a GenAI tool and compare the results.

### Prompt 1

### Prompt 2

---

**Context:**  
I am a first-year university student in Hong Kong, writing a summary of an academic journal article.

**Instructions:**  
Write a short summary (250 words) for this article (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020), including these elements: a brief description of the study, main arguments/claims, evidence, suggestions, and a conclusion.

**Details:**  
Use a formal and academic tone. Use APA 7th edition citation format and cite all non-original ideas.

**Input:**  
Write the summary based on this article:  
Andrejevic, M., & Selwyn, N. (2020). Facial recognition technology in schools: Critical questions and concerns. *Learning, Media and Technology, 45*(2), 115-128. https://doi.org/10.1080/17439884.2020.1686014

Read the article by Andrejevic, M., & Selwyn, N. (2020). Facial recognition technology in schools: Critical questions and concerns. *Learning, Media and Technology, 45*(2), 115-128. https://doi.org/10.1080/17439884.2020.1686014

Then, write a 250-word academic summary.

---

The clarity and accuracy of the prompts GenAI receives determine the quality of the output. There are many different ways to construct effective prompts. For example, your prompts can be structured around these elements following the **CIDI framework** (Ryan, 2024):

---

## 1. Context

Define the role of AI in your task.  
*e.g.*  
> "You are a first-year university student in Hong Kong writing a synthesis and summary of arguments/claims and evidence from two articles."

This helps guide the AI's perspective and approach.

---

## 2. Instructions

Outline the specific tasks you want AI to perform. Be precise. If you need GenAI to help summarise an article, specify what elements should be included, such as main arguments/claims, key findings, conclusion, etc.

*E.g.*  
> "Summarise the article on the impact of global warming, including the main argument/claim, key findings, and any recommendations made by the authors."

If you want more specific output from GenAI, try giving it some guiding questions.

*e.g.*

> Please summarise the following article on global warming. Include the following elements in your summary:
>
> - **Key findings:** What are the main results or conclusions regarding the effects of global warming presented in the article?
> - **Limitations:** What limitations of the study regarding global warming are mentioned by the authors?
> - **Implications:** What do the authors suggest for future research or practical applications related to global warming based on their findings?

---

## 3. Details

Include any important details that frame how the output should be presented. For example, if the summary/synthesis should focus on a specific cultural context or historical period, make that clear.

Include constraints or requirements, such as:

> "Use a formal academic writing tone and academic vocabulary."

---

## 4. Input

Give GenAI the input it needs to perform the task. This might include articles, excerpts from articles, or any relevant background information.

## Task 1: Determining if the Text is a Reasonable Instance of Synthesis

Read the following sentences and determine whether they represent an effective instance of synthesis. As you evaluate each sentence, consider the following questions:

- **Is there a meaningful connection between the ideas?**
- **Assess whether the ideas presented in the sentence relate to each other in a way that contributes to a broader understanding of the topic?**
- **Is the synthesis put together logically?**
- **Evaluate if the ideas flow in a coherent manner, making it easy to follow the argument.**
- **Does the synthesis include two or more sources and a synthesis word?**
  - Check if the sentence references at least two different sources and uses synthesis vocabulary (e.g. "similarly," "in contrast," "however") to connect the ideas.
- **Are there identifiable sources with in-text citations?**
  - Ensure that the sentence includes proper in-text citations for each source referenced, indicating the authors and the year of publication.

## Synthesising Example 1

Facial recognition technology is used in many places. McClellan (2020) argues that it is good for increasing public safety because it helps track down criminals quickly. Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) focus on facial recognition in schools and argue that it might not be beneficial for students. Smith and Miller (2021) point out that facial recognition may violate people’s privacy. In Seng et al.’s (2021) study, it was found that people generally dislike facial recognition because it feels creepy.

## Synthesising Example 2

The implementation of facial recognition technology faces various challenges. According to Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020), schools using this technology might spy on students too much. Caines (2021) indicates that facial recognition is used in lots of different ways, like in security and marketing. Also, Smith and Miller (2021) mention that people’s privacy could be at risk because of facial recognition.

---

## Synthesising Example 3

Despite its potential benefits, the rise of facial recognition technology (FRT) has sparked significant debate due to ethical and privacy concerns. McClellan (2020) highlights that FRT can enhance security in public spaces by enabling the rapid identification of criminal suspects, which is particularly valuable in high-risk environments like airports or large events. However, others are sceptical of its overall societal benefits. For example, Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) warn that FRT’s integration in schools might have severe negative effects, including the potential for pervasive surveillance and the infringement of student autonomy. Similarly, Smith and Miller (2021) argue that FRT’s collection and storage of biometric data might violate individual privacy rights, while there is a lack of regulatory frameworks to ensure accountability. Seng et al. (2021) further support this by noting that users in physical settings, such as retail or public spaces, often perceive FRT as intrusive, with many expressing distrust due to the lack of transparency in how their data is handled. Collectively, the literature suggests that while FRT offers security advantages, its deployment must be carefully scrutinised to address privacy concerns and public perceptions, particularly in sensitive contexts like education.

### Excerpt 1

**Seng et al. (2020, p. 13):**

> “Participants reported their lack of control and trust in FR-based authentication, where they are afraid that such technology would mistakenly authenticate adversaries allowing them access to valuable information and belongings. This lack of trust on efficacy is also one of the reasons why participants see a limited benefit in using FR to get personalised offers.”

---

### Excerpt 2

**McClellan (2020, pp. 375-376):**

> “Another serious concern is the potential for data breaches in facial recognition technology. When an account or social security number is breached, the password or number can be changed and replaced (Yurieff, 2017). However, when a fingerprint or facial recognition is compromised, there is no way to replace it — once a breach has occurred, there is almost no way to remedy it (See 740 ILL. COMP. STAT. 14/5, 2008).”

### Suggested Answer Generated by GenAI

> Both Seng et al. (2020) and McClellan (2020) highlight significant concerns regarding facial recognition (FR) technology, focusing on issues of trust and security. Seng et al. (2020) note that users lack confidence in FR-based authentication due to fears of erroneous authentication, which could allow unauthorised access to sensitive information or assets, leading to scepticism about its benefits, such as personalised offers (p. 13). Similarly, McClellan (2020) emphasises the severe consequences of data breaches in FR systems, pointing out that unlike passwords or social security numbers, compromised biometric data like facial recognition cannot be replaced, posing a significant and irreparable risk (pp. 375-376; 740 ILL. COMP. STAT. 14/5, 2008).

## Sample answer generated by GenAI

Caines (2021) and McClellan (2020) highlight critical concerns surrounding facial recognition (FR) technology, particularly its implications for privacy and transparency. Caines (2021) notes that trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements between FR vendors and government agencies often obstruct scrutiny of algorithmic performance, leaving individuals, such as criminal defendants, unable to challenge FR use in their cases. Similarly, McClellan (2020) emphasises the need for federal regulations to protect citizens’ privacy against potential violations by law enforcement and private companies, while still supporting FR’s benefits in criminal justice. Overall, these researchers underscore the urgent need for transparency and regulatory safeguards to balance FR’s advantages with its risks to privacy and fairness.

## ETHICS OF USING GEN AI FOR LEARNING/PRACTISING ACADEMIC WRITING

To maintain academic integrity, transparency, and the ethical use of generative AI tools, students have the responsibility to learn about the ethical risks of using AI and develop the skills and awareness necessary to minimise the risk of misuse.

---

### Citations and acknowledgement of AI use

The use of generative AI tools in assessment **without appropriate citations and acknowledgement** is considered academic dishonesty and potential plagiarism, which constitutes severe academic misconduct and requires disciplinary action. Thus, students must abide by the course guidelines and acknowledge any use of GenAI responsibly.

---

#### Q: Can I copy and paste AI-generated output into my assessed essays?

> “While improper use of generative AI tools is generally course and task-specific, asking generative AI tools to generate long pieces of text and copying and pasting them into an assessed task is NOT considered proper use.”
>
> — *Guidelines for Students on Academic Integrity* (2025)

**A:** In most scenarios, texts produced by generative AI tools are NOT considered reliable, accurate, or trustworthy representations of information. This is why a declaration and acknowledgement approach to the use of generative AI tools is needed. Students can refer to relevant style and citation guidelines from professional organisations, such as the American Psychological Association (APA), Modern Language Association (MLA), and the University of Chicago Press.

---

#### Q: What if I want to quote GenAI’s answer - can I just paraphrase it?

**A:** When you quote, paraphrase, or use part of or the entire output of Gen AI-generated text content, you must include a reference. Quoting AI-generated text is similar to sharing an algorithm’s output, and therefore, students should credit the author of the algorithm (e.g. OpenAI for ChatGPT) with a reference list entry and the corresponding in-text citation.

---

#### Q: What if I used GenAI for editing?

---

**A:** All functional uses of AI, such as editing or translating text, should be mentioned in the acknowledgments section (if there is one), in the text itself, or in another appropriate section.

---

## How to acknowledge AI use in your assessments?

In summary, include the following statements in your assessments:

- ✓ Written acknowledgement of the generative AI tool used and for what purpose
- ✓ In-text citations if any AI-generated texts are used, paraphrased, or modified
- ✓ The prompt(s) used to generate the content
- ✓ A note on any modifications that you made
- ✓ The original output with your submission (e.g. screenshot of the chat record)

## Two Practice Tasks on Summarizing, Paraphrasing and Synthesizing Ideas

### Instructions

1. **Read** the excerpts of TWO academic journal articles (Articles A and B).

2. **FRT** has been increasingly adopted in different public spaces, including schools. Different views about the adoption of FRT in elementary schools from researchers and other stakeholders have been seen in the research literature.

   **Your task:**  
   Summarise, paraphrase, and synthesise the main claims or arguments from the TWO excerpts on the adoption of FRT in schools in **no more than 300 words**.

   - Do **NOT** include your own views in the summary.
   - Do **NOT** directly copy sentences from the excerpts – you need to write them in your own words.
   - Do **NOT** summarise and synthesise ideas from the Abstracts of the two excerpts.

3. **Use APA in-text citations (7th edition)\*** to acknowledge ideas from the article in your writing. However, the abstract should **NOT** be cited, as its purpose is to contextualise the excerpt. End-of-text citations or a reference list is **NOT** required.

   > **Examples:**
   >
   > - **Author-prominent style:** `[author’s surname] + [a reporting verb]`  
   >   *E.g.,*  
   >   `Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) report that facial recognition technologies are widely adopted in schools.`
   >
   > - **Signal-phrase style:**  
   >   *E.g.,*  
   >   `According to Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020), facial recognition technologies are widely adopted in schools.`
   >
   > - **Information-prominent style:** `[cite the author’s name after the information or at the end of the sentence]`  
   >   *E.g.,*  
   >   `Facial recognition technologies are widely adopted in schools (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).`

4. **Write in paragraph form** and adopt the following general structure for your summary:

   - **Introduction** (including background and a thesis statement)
   - **Body paragraph(s)** (including a topic sentence for each body paragraph)
   - **Conclusion**

5. **You are NOT allowed to use any online or AI tools** (including online dictionaries, paraphrasing or translation apps).

## An excerpt from Article A

### Supporting schools to use face recognition systems: a continuance intention perspective of elementary school parents in China

**Jon-Chao Hong, Yushun Li, Shuo-Ying Kuo, Xin An**  
2022

---

### Abstract

A great deal of attention has been focused on technological innovation, for example, face recognition, which has been used in some countries in various fields. Nonetheless, there has been little attention paid to parents’ acceptance of the use of face recognition systems on campus. To address this gap in the literature, this study examined how different degrees of technological innovativeness<sup>1</sup> and dangerous beliefs in the virtual world (DBVW)<sup>2</sup> influence parents’ perceived value<sup>3</sup> of using and intention to continue supporting schools’ use of face recognition systems.

This study adopted snowball sampling<sup>4</sup> to collect data through questionnaires, and received 380 valid responses from parents living in Xuzhou, China. Confirmatory factor analysis<sup>5</sup> and structural equation modelling<sup>6</sup> were used to analyse the data, with results indicating that:

1. **DBVW was negatively related to perceived value;**
2. **Technological innovativeness was positively related to perceived value;**
3. **Perceived value was positively related to continuance intention<sup>7</sup> to use face recognition systems.**

The results suggest that parents support the use of face recognition systems in elementary schools; thus, such systems can be adopted by other elementary schools in other areas.

---

### Discussion

Although implicit and explicit attitudes are different, they can both affect behaviours, and individuals’ attitude can promote the value perception before performing a behaviour (Kaiser et al., 2021). In line with this, the present study explored parents’ DBVW and technological innovativeness in the value perception of the use of face-recognition systems, and continuous intention to use such systems as a research framework. The results indicate that the average score of parents’ DBVW is 3.865, which is higher than the average level (3.000), indicating that

The parents were worried about the disclosure of students’ personal privacy, and generally had a cautious attitude towards new technologies (Perry & Sibley, 2010). The average score of parents’ technological innovativeness is **3.796**, which is higher than the average level (**3.000**), indicating that the parent respondents tended to accept new technology (Wang & Lee, 2020). The average score of parents’ perceived value is **3.919**, which is much higher than the neutral level (**3.000**), indicating that the parents generally recognize the value of face recognition systems (Kim et al., 2007). The average score of CIU is **3.776**, which is higher than the neutral level (**3.000**), indicating that the respondents generally preferred to continue using the face recognition system at the campus entrance. On the whole, although the parent respondents thought that the face recognition system had certain risks, they were willing to try technological innovation and they thought the system was valuable, so they intended to continue using it.

According to the results of the path analysis coefficient test, the **DBVW** was negatively correlated with perceived value, supporting H1 (**DBVW is negatively related to perceived value**), which is consistent with previous studies (Dhaggara et al., 2020). The results of this study indicate that there was a significant negative correlation between users’ anxiety about face recognition technology and their perceived usefulness. When users could trust that they had information security on the Internet, they would have lower information leakage anxiety and higher use intention (Singh & Sinha, 2020). Therefore, this study suggests that the higher the parents’ DBVW, the lower the value they perceived.

The results of the path analysis coefficient test revealed that technological innovativeness has a positive correlation with perceived value, supporting H2 (**Technological innovativeness was positively related to perceived value**). The results are consistent with previous studies (Albertsen et al., 2020; Lee, 2013), which proved that personal innovation had a positive relationship with perceived usefulness which accounts for the relationship between parents’ technological innovativeness and perceived value in this research. This study found that the higher the technological innovativeness, the higher the perceived value.

## Appendix – An excerpt from Article B

### Facial recognition technology in schools: critical questions and concerns

**Mark Andrejevic & Neil Selwyn**  
2020

---

### Abstract

Facial recognition technology is now being introduced across various aspects of public life.  
This includes the burgeoning<sup>1</sup> integration of facial recognition and facial detection into compulsory<sup>2</sup> schooling to address issues such as campus security, automated registration and student emotion detection. So far, these technologies have largely been seen as routine additions to school systems with already extensive cultures of monitoring and surveillance<sup>3</sup>.

While critical commentators are beginning to question the pedagogical<sup>4</sup> limitations of facially driven<sup>5</sup> learning, this article contends that school-based facial recognition presents a number of other social challenges and concerns that merit specific attention. This includes the likelihood of facial recognition technology altering the nature of schools and schooling along divisive<sup>6</sup>, authoritarian<sup>7</sup> and oppressive lines. Against this background, the article considers whether or not a valid case can ever be made for allowing this form of technology in schools.

---

### Discussion

#### Challenging the take-up of facial recognition in schools

These questions over diminished notions of pedagogy and consent<sup>8</sup> are important. Yet, at this point, we would like to argue that there are a number of additional issues and concerns that cast further serious doubt upon the implementation of facial recognition technologies in schools. In brief, the following points of contention<sup>9</sup> might be raised:

---

#### The inescapable nature of school-based facial recognition

Another point of concern is the inescapability<sup>10</sup> of facial monitoring within school contexts. Unlike other forms of personal data (i.e., any piece of data connected to an individual’s name), facial data lends itself to constant and permanent surveillance. In short, people are always connected to their faces. Thus, unlike social media posts or interactions with school learning

Management systems, there is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they ‘share’. While students might be able to opt-out<sup>11</sup> from facial detection elements of their school’s learning systems (for example, the use of eye-tracking or facial thermal imaging for learning analytics), there is no right to decline to participate in ‘non-cooperative’ facial recognition systems (indeed, any opt-out effectively renders campus facial recognition systems ineffective). While such coercion<sup>12</sup> applies to the use of facial recognition in all public spaces, it is especially acute in schools. For example, most schools enforce dress codes that preclude students’ faces being covered by hair, hoods or other obtrusions<sup>13</sup>. This makes it difficult for students to obscure their faces from surveillance cameras. This also raises the inadequacy of any promise of ‘informed consent<sup>14</sup>’ regarding school facial recognition systems. The systems being deployed in schools for security and attendance purposes rely on complete sweeps of classrooms and corridors in order to operate. This renders ‘opt-in<sup>15</sup>’ and ‘opt-out’ approaches counter-productive from the point of view of the system provider. Even if opt-out protocols<sup>16</sup> are in place, the system has to scan a student’s face before it can recognise that they have opted out.

## A Step-by-Step Guide on What to Summarize and Synthesize

### Extracting Key Points and Arguments/Claims, and Synthesizing Ideas from the Articles

---

### Step 1: Read Actively and Annotate the Articles on Facial Recognition Technology (FRT)

Start by reading the main texts multiple times. Highlight major claims/arguments, important findings or evidence, implications, and conclusion within the text. Note all key terms from the excerpts (e.g., DBVW as worries about privacy disclosure; inescapability of facial data).

- For an **empirical journal article**, the key findings usually include data/figures, but you should not include the specific numbers in your summarised version. Just summarise the main findings – see below for details.
- For a **conceptual journal article**, the evidence may refer to examples, explanations and reasons, but you do not need to summarise all the examples. Just summarise 1-2 examples.

#### Example Articles

| Article                         | Type         | Highlights                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hong et al. (2022)               | Empirical    | - Parents’ average scores (e.g., DBVW: 3.865, indicating concerns about FRT for their children’s privacy in elementary schools)<br>- Technological innovativeness: 3.796, showing acceptance of new FRT<br>- Continued intention to use FRT in schools: 3.776 |
| Andrejevic & Selwyn (2020)       | Conceptual   | - Concerns brought by FRT, such as "inescapable" surveillance, no true opt-out or informed consent, and coercion via school rules |

---

### Step 2: Extract Key Points: Arguments/Claims, Evidence and Implications from Texts

Organise the key ideas into bullet points by paraphrasing them (e.g., specific concerns and major findings). Categorize the bullet points into:

- **Claims/Arguments**
- **Evidence** (data/examples/explanations)
- **Implications**
- **Conclusion**

> **Note:**  
> - Do NOT copy directly from the abstracts.  
> - Do NOT summarize detailed data like figures/numbers and detailed examples for this task.

Andrejevic & Selwyn (2020)

---

## Claim/Argument

**Hong et al. (2022):**  
Although parents worry about students’ privacy in elementary schools, they support the continued use of FRT on school campuses.

### Evidence

- Parents show DBVW (score 3.865 > neutral), negatively correlated with perceived value.
- Technological innovativeness (3.796) positively correlated with perceived value (3.919) of FRT, leading to continuance intention (3.776) to support FRT.

### Implication/Conclusion

Despite acknowledging privacy risks, parents value and intend to support the continued use of FRT due to its value and innovativeness.

---

**Andrejevic & Selwyn (2020):**  
FRT leads to concerns: constant surveillance in schools.

### Evidence

- No opt-out mechanism is possible because FRT scans all faces; students cannot hide their faces.
- Informed consent is inadequate.

### Implication/Conclusion

Raises serious concerns about the adoption of FRT in schools, implying coercion in education.

---

## Step 3: Identify Common/Similar Themes, Contrasts, and Gaps

After extracting key points from each excerpt separately (in Step 2), compare them side-by-side. Look for:

- **Common/Similar themes:** Main ideas/themes that appear in both excerpts (e.g., concerns about risks or privacy).
- **Contrasts:** Ways in which the excerpts disagree or present opposing views (e.g., one offers reasons for acceptance of FRT; the other offers reasons for rejection).
- **Gaps:** Aspects covered in one excerpt but not the other (e.g., one focuses on parents' attitudes towards the adoption of FRT in schools; the other focuses on concerns brought by FRT in the broader school system without data).

This comparison helps you see connections and tensions, which is essential for synthesis—you are not just listing points from each source separately but preparing to combine them meaningfully.

---

### Examples Based on the Excerpts

- **Common/Similar theme:**  
  Both articles address the risks associated with FRT, specifically privacy worries and data disclosure in Hong et al. (2022), versus constant surveillance and a lack of consent in Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020).

- **Contrasts:**  
  Hong et al. (2022) show that parents intend to continue to use FRT despite the risks associated with privacy due to its innovativeness and value.  
  However, Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) argue that FRT scans students’ faces at all times, compromising their privacy and making it coercive. This raises serious doubts about...

its adoption on school campuses.

- **Gaps:** Hong et al. (2022) are parent-centered and present quantitative evidence (e.g., scores and correlations) to support their claims/arguments. Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) focus on students/schools and present reasons and examples (e.g., no opt-out mechanism; dress codes) to support their claims/arguments.

---

## Step 4: Synthesize the Ideas into a Cohesive Whole

Now combine the separate points (from Step 2) and comparisons (from Step 3) into one coherent piece of writing. Do not summarize each excerpt one after the other. Rather, integrate them by discussing shared themes, contrasts, and overall implications together. Use connecting words/phrases (e.g., "while," "however," "in contrast,") to link the main ideas smoothly. The goal is to create a balanced synthesis that shows how the articles relate to the main topic (i.e. FRT adoption in schools), highlighting tensions or agreements.

**Example based on the excerpts:**

- Start with a broad statement on the topic:  
  *"Views on FRT in schools reveal a tension between practical acceptance and ethical concerns."*

- Integrate similar themes/contrasts:  
  *"Parents exhibit dangerous beliefs in the virtual world (DBVW), which are related to concerns about their children’s privacy at schools; yet they support the continued use of FRT due to its usefulness and innovativeness (Hong et al., 2022). However, this pragmatic acceptance is challenged by the technology's constant surveillance, lack of true opt-out, and excessive control in school settings (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020)."*

- End with a conclusion based on the main ideas:  
  *"Overall, these perspectives highlight a conflict: stakeholder willingness to adopt FRT despite privacy risks versus fundamental doubts about FRT's compatibility with non-oppressive education."*

---

## Step 5: Review and Refine

Finally, make sure all the points retain the meaning of the original texts, while preserving neutrality and completeness. Ensure all claims/arguments and evidence summarised/synthesised are concise, paraphrased and properly cited.

### Follow this organizational structure when you write the summary/synthesis:

#### Paragraph 1
- Introduce the topic – provide some background information on the topic
- Give a preview of your summary – what aspects your summary focuses on

#### Paragraph 2
- Use a sentence to synthesise similar claims/arguments from the two articles (add the two sources in the in-text citation)
- Mention what each source indicates, that is, explain the claim/argument and evidence in more detail.

#### Paragraph 3
- Use a sentence to synthesise contrasting claims/arguments from the two articles (add the two sources in the in-text citation)
- Mention what each source indicates, that is, explain the claim/argument and evidence in more detail.

#### Paragraph 4
- Repeat the main claims/arguments and add implications, if any, in the conclusion. In-text citations are not needed in the conclusion.

## Suggested Sample Answer

Contrasting perspectives exist regarding the adoption of Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) in schools in terms of its acceptability and implications. This summary focuses on the risks associated with FRT in school environments and whether it should be implemented from the perspectives of parents’ perceptions on the technology and privacy concerns about students.

Previous studies highlight some risks associated with FRT in school environments (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020; Hong et al., 2022). Parents demonstrate concerns about privacy and data disclosure, reflected in elevated scores for dangerous beliefs in the virtual world (DBVW) that negatively influence their perception of the technology's value (Hong et al., 2022). Similarly, as pointed out by Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020), facial data enables ongoing surveillance and raises privacy issues, compounded by the lack of meaningful consent in school settings where students cannot easily conceal their faces to avoid being scanned by the technology.

However, there is also significant divergence among scholars in the evaluation of whether these risks of FRT justify its adoption (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020; Hong et al., 2022). Hong et al. (2022), who conducted surveys with parents on FRT’s acceptability, found that FRT’s technological innovativeness and usefulness counteract privacy worries, leading to parents’ general preference for the continued adoption of FRT on school campuses. By contrast, the technology's inescapable nature requiring full scans for operation and reinforced by school policies that prevent the concealment of faces, creates an authoritarian environment that undermines autonomy, casting doubt on its suitability despite its perceived benefits (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).

In conclusion, the current debate on FRT in schools reflects a divide between pragmatic stakeholder acceptance, where innovation and usefulness mitigate acknowledged risks, and ethical objections that view the technology as inherently problematic due to its potential for non-consensual monitoring in educational contexts.

### Telework in academia: associations with health and well-being among staff

**Marina Heiden, Linda Widar, Birgitta Wiitavaara, Eva Boman**  
2020

---

#### Abstract

As the development of technical aids for telework has progressed, work has become more flexible in time and space. Among academics<sup>1</sup>, the opportunity to telework has been embraced by most, but it is unclear how it relates to their health and well-being. The aim of this study was to determine how frequency and amount of telework associated with perceived health, stress, recuperation<sup>2</sup>, work-life balance, and intrinsic<sup>3</sup> work motivation among teaching and research academics<sup>4</sup>. An electronic questionnaire was sent to junior lecturers, senior lecturers, and professors at Swedish public universities. It included the General Health Questionnaire, Work Stress Questionnaire, items for assessing recuperation, the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction at Work scale, and parts of Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire, as well as questions about the frequency and amount of telework performed. In total, 392 academics responded to the survey. Multivariate analysis of variance showed significant differences between groups of academics with different telework frequency (p < 0.05). Univariate analyses of variance showed that ratings of stress related to indistinct organisation<sup>5</sup> and

Conflicts were higher among academics that telework several times per week or more than among academics that telework less than once per month. In regression analyses of associations between amount of telework (in hours per week) and the dependent variables<sup>6</sup>, no significant effects were found. Although it cannot be concluded whether stress is a cause or an effect of frequent telework, the findings warrant further attention to academics who telework frequently.

---

## Discussion

It has been argued that telework facilitates the balancing of competing work and family demands (Fonner & Roloff, 2010; Percival et al., 2011). That does not appear to be the case among academics. We found no difference in ratings of work-life balance between lecturers and professors with different telework frequency or any association between the amount of telework performed per week and perceived work-life balance. Golden et al. (2006) showed that as the extent of telework increases, individuals experience less work-to-family conflict<sup>7</sup> but more family-to-work conflict<sup>8</sup>. Thus, they may cancel each other out, leading to no effect of telework on overall work-life balance. In this study, most of the items included in the scales focused on work-to-family conflict rather than family-to-work conflict. Yet, we found no support for work-to-family conflict being related to the extent of telework in this population. The findings are in agreement with a recent study on employees in Swedish government agencies (including one university), where Thulin et al. (2019) showed that perceived control over daily time use was not related to teleworking practice or type of work (i.e., predominantly routine case control tasks or predominantly autonomous and investigative tasks).

We found no difference in ratings of relatedness to other colleagues between lecturers and professors that telework to different extents. This may lend support to previous findings that telework has limited impact on communication within the organisation and that high-frequent teleworkers are not being left out of the network (Belanger, 1999; Duxbury & Neufeld, 1999). From this study, however, the impact of telework can only be understood from the perspective of the individual who teleworks. It is possible that lower levels of stress due to meetings and interruptions that have been reported among teleworkers (Fonner & Roloff, 2010) are achieved at the expense of others having to do more service work (Bailey & Kurland, 2002; Percival et al., 2011), and this could lead to conflicts between colleagues. Indeed, we found higher ratings of stress related to indistinct organisation and conflicts among academics that telework frequently.

### Researchers working from home: Benefits and challenges

**Balazs Aczel, Marton Kovacs, Tanja van der Lippe, Barnabas Szaszi**  
2021

---

### Abstract

The flexibility allowed by the mobilisation of technology disintegrated the traditional work-life boundary for most professionals. Whether working from home (WFH) is the key or impediment to academics’<sup>1</sup> efficiency and work-life balance became a daunting<sup>2</sup> question for both scientists and their employers. The recent pandemic brought into focus the merits and challenges of working from home on a level of personal experience. Using a convenient sampling, we surveyed 704 academics while working from home and found that the pandemic lockdown<sup>3</sup> decreased the work efficiency for almost half of the researchers but around a quarter of them were more efficient during this time compared to the time before.

Based on the gathered personal experience, 70% of the researchers think that in the future they would be similarly or more efficient than before if they could spend more of their work-time<sup>4</sup> at home. They indicated that in the office they are better at sharing thoughts with colleagues, keeping in touch with their team, and collecting data, whereas at home they are better at working on their manuscript<sup>5</sup>, reading the literature, and analysing their data. Taking well-being also into account, 66% of them would find it ideal to work more from home in the...

...future than they did before the lockdown. These results draw attention to how working from home is becoming a major element of researchers’ life and that we have to learn more about its influencer factors and coping tactics<sup>6</sup> in order to optimise its arrangements.

---

## Discussion

Our results showed that while the pandemic-related lockdown decreased the work efficiency for almost half of the researchers (47%), around a quarter (23%) of them experienced that they were more efficient during this time compared to the time before. Based on personal experience, 70% of the researchers think that after the lockdown they would be similarly (41%) or more efficient (29%) than before if they could spend more of their worktime at home.

The remaining 30% thought that after the lockdown their work efficiency would decrease if they worked from home, which is noticeably lower than the 47% who claimed the same for the lockdown period. From these values we speculate that some of the obstacles of their work efficiency were specific to the pandemic lockdown.

Furthermore, we found that working from the office and working from home support different aspects of research. Not surprisingly, activities that involve colleagues or team members are better bound to the office, but tasks that need focussed attention, such as working on the manuscript or analysing the data are better achieved from home.

A central motivation of our study was to explore what proportion of their worktime researchers would find ideal to work from home, concerning both research efficiency and work-life balance. Two thirds of the researchers indicated that it would be better to work more from home in the future. It seemed that sharing work somewhat equally between the two venues is the most preferred arrangement. A great majority (86%) of those who would like to work more from home in the future, think that it would be possible to do so.

As a conclusion, both the work and non-work life of researchers would take benefits should more WFH be allowed and neither workplace duties, nor their domestic circumstances are limits of such a change. That researchers have a preference to work more from home, might be due to the fact that they are more and more pressured by their work. Finishing manuscripts, and reading literature is easier to find time for when working from home.

## Suggested Sample Answer with Annotations on How It Is Organised

Research on telework or working from home suggests that it can help employees better manage their work and family responsibilities (Fonner & Roloff, 2010; Percival et al., 2011, as cited in Heiden et al., 2020). This summary examines telework for academics, exploring whether it leads to better work-life balance, stronger collegial relationships, and higher productivity among academics.  
*(the topic is introduced and a clear overview of the summary is given)*

Researchers differ in terms of whether telework fosters better relationships between academics and whether certain collaborative tasks can be completed from home (Aczel et al., 2021; Heiden et al., 2020). Heiden et al. (2020) found that collegial relatedness remains unaffected by the frequency of telework, suggesting that academics are not isolated from organisational networks, though this comes with higher stress from unclear structures and conflicts. However, as indicated by Aczel et al. (2021), telework may not be conducive to tasks requiring information sharing with colleagues, meaning such tasks are better completed in the workplace.  
*(the topic sentence shows a synthesis of similar ideas from the two articles. In-text citations are used and the ideas are paraphrased).*

Other aspects of telework are also worth noting. While one study showed no significant effect of telework on academics’ perceived work-life balance, specifically in easing work-to-family conflict across different amounts of telework (Heiden et al., 2020), another study revealed that academics felt more efficient in completing certain tasks when they worked from home. These tasks require concentration, such as drafting manuscripts and performing data analysis. Therefore, the majority of academics in that study indicated a preference for working from home in the future (Aczel et al., 2021).  
*(the topic sentence shows a synthesis of contrasting ideas from the two articles. In-text citations are used and the ideas are paraphrased).*

Overall, the debate over academic telework revolves around whether it can benefit both academics’ professional and personal lives, enhance task-specific productivity, and affect collegial relationships.  
*(the main ideas/claims/arguments are repeated in the conclusion. In-text citations are not needed in the conclusion).*
