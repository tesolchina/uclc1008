## Part 1 – Introduction of Academic Journal Articles

### Purpose of this Part

University-level English courses require you to engage deeply with complex ideas. In this section, you will learn how to effectively read academic journal articles – not just for comprehension, but for critical analysis, argument identification, and information extraction. These skills are fundamental for all your university studies, and they are especially crucial for successfully developing your upcoming Argument Construction and Evaluation assignment.

---

There are two broad types of academic journal articles, namely **empirical** and **conceptual**. Since they are published in academic journals, they are also called **journal papers** or **journal articles**.

Many academic fields, especially in science, social sciences, psychology, and some areas of humanities, rely heavily on **empirical research**. This means the authors conducted their own studies, collected data, and analysed it to answer a specific research question. Understanding how to read these types of papers is essential for evaluating evidence and incorporating it into your own arguments.

Instead of presenting new data from experiments or surveys, many papers in English and the humanities are **conceptual** (or theoretical). These papers develop new theories, critique existing ideas, analyse concepts, or synthesise arguments without conducting new empirical research. Understanding how to read and engage with these papers is vital for developing your own nuanced arguments.

## Part 2 – How to Read and Select Main Ideas from Journal Articles?

### Purpose of this Part

You will be equipped with the skills to effectively read academic journal articles – not just for comprehension, but for critical analysis, argument identification, and information extraction because university-level English courses require you to engage deeply with complex ideas. These skills are not only fundamental for all your university studies, but they are also crucial for successfully developing your upcoming assignments: **Academic Writing Quiz** and **Argument Construction and Evaluation**.

---

## Activity 2.1: Step 1 - Analyse the Title

The title of an academic journal article is a concise, informative phrase that summarises the study's core focus and findings.

### What to read and how?

- **Identify the Subject Matter** (broad topic)
- **Understand the Context** (specific focus of the paper)
- **Determine the Purpose / Stance** (based on word choice and connotations)
    - **Support/Endorse:** The author agrees with a specific idea, theory or approach
    - **Promote/Advocate:** The author actively argues for adopting a specific policy
    - **Reject/Refute:** The author argues against a specific idea or theory
    - **Doubt / Question / Challenge:** The author raises critical points or identifies problems of a specific idea
    - **Discuss:** The author critically summarises and evaluates current research on a topic

---

### Example: Hong et al. (2022)

> **Supporting schools to use face recognition systems: A continuance intention perspective of elementary school parents in China**

- **Subject Matter:** Face recognition systems
- **Context:** Continuance intention perspective, elementary school parents in China
- **Purpose / Stance:** Support (“Supporting”)

The abstract of a conceptual paper differs from an empirical one because the focus shifts from analysis of data to discussion of ideas and arguments. Therefore, it will not contain Methods and Results sections, but will focus on:

1. the theoretical problem or gap the author is addressing,
2. the author’s argument or interpretation, and
3. the analytical approach adopted by the author to develop the argument

## Example: Hong et al. (2022)

| Text | Annotation/Analysis |
|------|---------------------|
| A great deal of attention has been focused on technological innovation, for example, face recognition, which has been used in some countries in various fields. Nonetheless, there has been little attention paid to parents’ acceptance of the use of face recognition systems on campus. To address this gap in the literature, this study examined how different degrees of technological innovativeness and dangerous beliefs in the virtual world (DBVW) influence parents’ perceived value of using and intention to continue supporting schools’ use of face recognition systems. This study adopted snowball sampling to collect data through questionnaires, and received 380 valid responses from parents living in Xuzhou, China. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were used to analyse the data, with results indicating that: (1) DBVW was negatively related to perceived value; (2) technological innovativeness was positively related to perceived value; and (3) perceived value was positively related to continuance intention to use face recognition systems. The results suggest that parents support the use of face recognition systems in elementary schools; thus, such systems can be adopted by other elementary schools in other areas. | **Background Information**<br>- Technological innovation → face recognition (FR) → various use of FR → parents’ acceptance of FR on campus<br>[Subject Matter + Context] |

| Facial recognition technology is now being introduced across various aspects of public life. This includes the burgeoning integration of facial recognition and facial detection into compulsory schooling to address issues such as campus security, automated registration and student emotion detection. So far, these technologies have largely been seen as routine additions to school systems with already extensive cultures of monitoring and surveillance. While critical commentators are beginning to question the pedagogical limitations of facially driven learning, this article contends that school-based facial recognition presents a number of other social challenges and concerns that merit specific attention. This includes the likelihood of facial recognition technology altering the nature of schools and schooling along divisive, authoritarian and oppressive lines. Against this background, the article considers whether or not a valid case can ever be made for allowing this form of technology in schools. | **Background Information**<br>- Public life → schools → use of FRT in schools, e.g., monitoring and surveillance<br>[Subject Matter + Context] |

### Purpose Statement

- Contrast other commentators’ focus on pedagogical limitations
- This article (study) focuses on social challenges and concerns

### Conclusion

- The author uses "can ever" to introduce scepticism. The word "Ever" may imply that the author sees significant challenges, even impossibility, in justifying the technology.

| As the development of technical aids for telework has progressed, work has become more flexible in time and space. Among academics, the opportunity to telework has been embraced by most, but it is unclear how it relates to their health and well-being. The aim of this study was to determine how frequency and amount of telework associated with perceived health, stress, recuperation, work-life balance, and intrinsic work motivation among teaching and research academics. An electronic questionnaire was sent to junior lecturers, senior lecturers, and professors at Swedish public universities. It included the General Health Questionnaire, Work Stress Questionnaire, items for assessing recuperation, the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction at Work scale, and parts of Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire, as well as questions about the frequency and amount of telework performed. In total, 392 academics responded to the survey. Multivariate analysis of variance showed significant differences between groups of academics with different telework frequency (p < 0.05). Univariate analyses of variance showed that ratings of stress related to indistinct organisation and conflicts were higher among academics that telework several times per week or more than among academics that telework less than once |  |

> per month. In regression analyses of associations between amount of telework (in hours per week) and the dependent variables, no significant effects were found. Although it cannot be concluded whether stress is a cause or an effect of frequent telework, the findings warrant further attention to academics who telework frequently.

### Text

Popular representations of remote work often depict it as a flexible, technologically feasible, and family-friendly work arrangement. Have the images of remote working as a desirable work arrangement been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic? What have we learned from the widespread involuntary remote work imposed on many employees during this time? To answer these questions, we analysed 40 recent empirical studies that examined work-life balance while working from home during the pandemic. Our analysis was informed by the person-environment fit theory and complemented by literature reviews on remote work conducted prior to the pandemic. We found four themes representing misfits between desirable expectations and the undesirable realities of remote work:

1. **Flextime vs. work intensity**
2. **Flexplace vs. space limitation**
3. **Technologically-feasible work arrangement vs. technostress and isolation**
4. **Family-friendly work arrangement vs. housework and care intensity**

We highlight the important role HRD practitioners can play in assisting employees to

## Activity 2.4: Step 4 - Identify and Analyse Topic Sentence and Concluding Sentence

Academic papers are built on arguments. To truly understand and critically engage with an article, you need to be able to identify the author’s main argument or stance (in **purpose statement**) and the individual points they use to support it (in **topic sentences**). These are the “signposts” that guide you through the author’s logic.

---

### Purpose Statement

This statement expresses the central argument or main point of the entire paper. It is usually found towards the end of the Introduction section. It should be a **debatable claim**, rather than a statement of fact or a question, that the rest of the paper will support.

---

### Topic Sentence

This is a sentence which contains the main idea or claim of a single body paragraph. It is usually the first sentence of a body paragraph (though sometimes it can be the second, or implied). It introduces the specific point that the rest of that paragraph will discuss and support with evidence. It should clearly connect back to and support the overall purpose statement.

---

The following is an excerpt from the discussion part of the two articles we discussed earlier:

---

## What to do and how?

- **Relate the Topic Sentence to Key Findings/Arguments**
- **Distinguish between Authors’ Claims** (for the Stance, supporting the main arguments) **and Opponents’ Claims** (against the Stance, counterarguments or critiques). Relate the claims to the Stance (found in the Purpose Statement in the Introduction).
- **Focus on Explanations** (how Claims are logically supported and linked to Evidence)
- **Determine if each paragraph includes a concluding sentence** which connects with the Key Findings/Arguments presented in the topic sentence. (Note that some paragraphs may include concluding sentences, while some may not.)
- **Distinguish detailed/specific Evidence/Data from Claims** (because examples/data do not speak for the Stance)

## Example: Hong et al. (2022) (Discussion part)

| Text | Annotation/Analysis |
|------|---------------------|
| Although implicit and explicit attitudes are different, they can both affect behaviours, and individuals’ attitude can promote the value perception before performing a behaviour (Kaiser et al., 2021). In line with this, the present study explored parents’ DBVW and technological innovativeness in the value perception of the use of face-recognition systems, and continuous intention to use such systems as a research framework. The results indicate that the average score of parents’ DBVW is 3.865, which is higher than the average level (3.000), indicating that the parents were worried about the disclosure of students’ personal privacy, and generally had a cautious attitude towards new technologies (Perry & Sibley, 2010). The average score of parents’ technological innovativeness is 3.796, which is higher than the average level (3.000), indicating that the parent respondents tended to accept new technology (Wang & Lee, 2020). The average score of parents’ perceived value is 3.919, which is much higher than the neutral level (3.000), indicating that the parents generally recognise the value of face recognition systems (Kim et al., 2007). The average score of CIU is 3.776, which is higher than the neutral level (3.000), indicating that the respondents generally preferred to continue using the face recognition system at the campus entrance. On the whole, although the parent respondents thought that the face recognition system had certain risks, they were willing to try technological innovation and they thought the system was valuable, so they intended to continue using it. | **Topic Sentence**<br>- The author explained the use of value perception to find out parents’ continuous intention to use FRT.<br>**Data #1**<br>**Finding #1**<br><br>**Data #2**<br>**Finding #2**<br>**Data #3**<br>**Finding #3**<br>**Data #4**<br>**Finding #4**<br><br>**Author’s Claim**<br>- Despite risks, the author generally supports the continuous use of FRT<br>[Stance: Support]<br><br>**Finding #5**<br><br><br><br>**Author’s elaboration on the finding** |
| According to the results of the path analysis coefficient test, the DBVW was negatively correlated with perceived value, supporting H1 (DBVW is negatively related to perceived value), which is consistent with previous studies (Dhaggara et al., 2020). The results of this study indicate that there was a significant negative correlation between users’ anxiety about face recognition technology and their perceived usefulness. | |

When users could trust that they had information security on the Internet, they would have lower information leakage anxiety and higher use intention (Singh & Sinha, 2020).

Therefore, this study suggests that the higher the parents’ DBVW, the lower the value they perceived.

The results of the path analysis coefficient test revealed that technological innovativeness has a positive correlation with perceived value, supporting H2 (Technological innovativeness was positively related to perceived value). The results are consistent with previous studies (Albertsen et al., 2020; Lee, 2013), which proved that personal innovation had a positive relationship with perceived usefulness which accounts for the relationship between parents’ technological innovativeness and perceived value in this research. This study found that the higher the technological innovativeness, the higher the perceived value.

#### Text

> **The inescapable nature of school-based facial recognition**
>
> Another point of concern is the inescapability of facial monitoring within school contexts. [E1] Unlike other forms of personal data (i.e., any piece of data connected to an individual’s name), facial data lends itself to constant and permanent surveillance. [E2] In short, people are always connected to their faces. Thus, unlike social media posts or interactions with school learning management systems, there is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they ‘share’. [E3] While students might be able to opt-out from facial detection elements of their school’s learning systems (for example, the use of eye-tracking or facial thermal imaging for learning analytics), there is no right to decline to participate in ‘non-cooperative’ facial recognition systems (indeed, any opt-out effectively renders campus facial recognition systems ineffective). [E4] While such coercion applies to the use of facial recognition in all public spaces, it is especially acute in schools. For example, most schools enforce dress codes that preclude students’ faces being covered by hair, hoods or other obtrusions. This makes it difficult for students to obscure their faces from surveillance cameras. [E5] This also raises the inadequacy of any promise of ‘informed consent’ regarding school facial recognition systems. The systems being deployed in schools for security and attendance purposes rely on complete sweeps of classrooms and corridors in order to operate. [E6] This renders ‘opt-in’ and ‘opt-out’ approaches counter-productive from the point of view of the system provider. Even if opt-out protocols are in place, the system has to scan a student’s face before it can recognise that they have opted out.

## Introduction

The past few years have seen the implementation of automated facial recognition systems across a range of social realms. While these technologies are associated most frequently with promises to strengthen public safety, a growing number of other applications have also emerged – from verifying the identity of bank users, through to ‘smart billboards’ that display advertisements in response to the moods of passers-by.

Of particular interest is how facial recognition technologies are beginning to be implemented in school settings. Indeed, there are now various educational applications of facial recognition and facial detection – including campus security systems, automated roll-calls and student emotion and attention monitoring. In countries such as the US, UK and Australia, these technologies have so far prompted little controversy or push-back. After all, schools in these countries have long utilised video camera surveillance systems and other forms of technology-based tracking and monitoring.

In this sense, facial recognition could be seen as a logical extension of technology-based surveillance trends established in schools from the 1990s onwards. However, in this article, we seek to problematise the specific connotations and possible consequences of facial recognition technology in schools. Drawing on emerging debates amongst communications, media and surveillance scholars, the article addresses a number of specific social challenges and concerns – not least various ways in which this technology might alter the nature of schools and schooling along divisive, authoritarian and oppressive lines. In light of recent calls from some commentators and activists for the outright banning of facial recognition in other areas of society, this paper considers whether (or not) these surveillance and monitoring technologies can ever be implemented in schools in ways that are not harmful and/or genuinely beneficial.

## 2. Read the two body paragraphs taken from the section ‘Facial recognition technologies in education’ in Andrejevic and Selwyn’s (2020) paper carefully.

As you read each paragraph, **highlight or underline the sentence you believe is the topic sentence of that paragraph**. Briefly explain why you think the sentence is the topic sentence. Does it introduce a clear point? Does it seem to be supported by the rest of the paragraph? Does it connect to the purpose statement?

### Facial recognition technologies in education

> One prominent educational application of facial recognition technology is campus security.  
> This form of facial recognition is most prevalent in the US, where school shooting incidents have prompted school authorities to annually spend $2.7 billion on campus security products and services (Doffman, 2018). Facial recognition systems have now been sold to thousands of US schools, with vendors “pitching the technology as an all-seeing shield against school shootings” (Harwell, 2018, n.p). As well as purporting to identify unauthorised intruders, systems have been developed to make use of video object classification trained to detect gun-shaped objects, alongside more subtle forms of ‘anomaly detection’ such as students arriving at school in different-than-usual clothes, bags and other apparel (Harwell, 2018). These systems promise to give school authorities an ability to initially determine who is permitted onto a school campus, and then support the tracking of identified individuals around the school site. As the marketing for the SAFR school system reasons, the capacity to know where students and staff are means that ‘schools can stay focused and better analyse potential threats’ (SAFR, 2019).

---

> Another application of facial recognition in schools is attendance monitoring – promising to put an end to the inevitable gaps and omissions that arise when human teachers are tasked with repeatedly conducting roll-calls of large student groups (Puthea et al., 2017). This application of facial recognition is proving popular in countries such as the UK and Australia where school shootings and unauthorised campus incursions are rare. For example, the Australian ‘Loop-Learn’ facial recognition roll-call system has been marketed amidst estimates of saving up to 2.5 hours of teacher time per week. Elsewhere, automated registration systems are also considered an effective means of overcoming problems of ‘fake attendance’ and ‘proxies’ – especially in countries such as India where fraudulent attendance is commonplace (Wagh et al., 2015).

|------|--------------------|
| **Introduction** |  |
| In recent years face recognition has become a hot biometric technology. It is not only the concern of large scientific and technological enterprises, but also has an important impact on the fields of finance, retail, medical treatment, and security in enterprises and government units. The frequent application of face recognition will further affect existing lifestyles and change the economic system and industries (Burt, 2019). Face recognition technology entered school campuses in China in 2006 (Liu, 2007) and has spread rapidly with the development of 5G since 2019. When a child passes through the school gate with an installed face recognition system, a notice will be sent to the parents’ mobile phones (Li, 2019), and students’ behaviors including violations on campus may also be reported to teachers or parents (Kong, 2019). The general public have concerns about whether this technology will infringe on human rights, resulting in racism and sexism (Dunn, 2020), due to the collection of individuals’ most private biometrics, and the inability to determine the threats that it brings (Baragchizadeh et al., 2017; Quinn, 2015). Particularly, the public | - Facial recognition technology (FRT) has a wide range of applications across industries.<br><br>- Specifically, in schools to administration and discipline.<br><br>- Therefore, sparking concerns among the public. |

Still, there are negative views on face recognition systems when they are applied to control access to campuses. Some parents have claimed that they violate the students’ privacy; some worry about the leakage of students’ personal information; and others are worried about insufficient funds and unclear usage standards (Qiu, 2017). In order to know how to obtain the trust and support of parents when implementing campus face recognition access control systems, it is necessary to explore the main influencing factors of parents’ intention to use them.

The **Dual Process Attitude Model** proposes two distinct types of attitude:

1. **Implicit attitude**  
   - A stable evaluation formed a priori, that is stored in special fast-access memory (Rydell & McConnell, 2006).

2. **Explicit attitude**  
   - Constructed through thoughtful processes; relevant information is deliberately accessed in the individual’s memory, and an evaluation of a device or object is developed within the current context (Serenko & Turel, 2019).

As belief can be automatically activated as a response to environmental cues, has many features of implicit attitude, and is stored in associative memory (Greenwald & Banaji, 1995), implicit attitude as beliefs stems from one’s ways of viewing the world (Clay, 2016). Additionally, people who view the world as being highly competitive and threatening might support novel actions which give them an advantage over others (Clay, 2016). Human values are defined as motivational goals and are guided by attitude that influences individual behaviors (Ihemezie et al., 2021). Given that attitudes toward the use of face-recognition systems may be campus-dependent, there is some justification for examining the attitude-value-behavior (Reser & Bentrupperbaumer, 2005) aspect of parents’ perspectives; thus, this study applied dangerous belief and technological innovativeness to explore the formation of continuous intention mediated by value perception.

The “attitude–behavior gap” appears in the context of information system adoption. That is, the information system depends strongly...

There is a need for more specific concern about the adoption process of information systems (El-Haddadeh et al., 2019). The Value-based Adoption Model (VAM) was proposed to explain the adoption of the Internet (Kim et al., 2007). In the research on VAM, perceived value is usually used to explain the behaviors of using a new technology, and is determined by people’s perception of the cost and benefit when using the new technology. VAM can be used to explain both the initial adoption intention (Kim et al., 2017) and post-adoption behaviors (Wang et al., 2020) as users need to keep considering the value while making continuance decisions (Wang et al., 2020). In line with this, VAM is useful for explaining the relationship between relative value advantage and continuance intention; thus, a model of Parents’ Acceptance of Face Recognition Technology in Campus Access Control was constructed in this study to address the research questions listed as follows:

---

## Research Questions

1. **Is there a relationship between parents’ dangerous beliefs in the virtual world (DBVW) and their perceived value of face recognition use on campuses?**
2. **Is there a relationship between parents’ technological innovativeness and their perceived value of face recognition use on campuses?**
3. **Is there a relationship between parents’ perceived value of face recognition and their continuance intention to use the technology as a campus control approach?**

---

## Evidence

- **Value-based Adoption Model Explanation**
    - Perception of cost and benefit affects adoption of new technology
    - In two stages:
        1. Initial adoption intention
        2. Post-adoption behaviours

## (GPT-4.1) Review of Bracketed Key Ideas for Accuracy

**Paragraph 1:**

- **(Background: facial recognition technology (FRT) has a wide range of applications across industries)**
    - Accurate. The text discusses FRT’s wide adoption in sectors like finance, retail, medicine, and security.
- **(Specifically, in schools to administration and discipline)**

---

### Paragraph 1

- **Accurate.** The paragraph describes school-based applications: access control, parental notifications, and reporting student behavior.  
  *(Therefore, sparking concerns among the public)*

- **Accurate.** The text outlines public concerns: privacy, data leakage, funding, and unclear standards.  
  *(Purpose statement - to investigate factors affecting parents’ attitudes towards FRT)*

- **Accurate.** The paragraph transitions to the need to study what influences parents’ acceptance of FRT in schools.

---

### Paragraph 2

*(Evidence: Dual Process Attitude Model - #1 Implicit attitude [Explanation: Preconception]; #2 Explicit attitude [Explanation: Informed opinion])*

- **Accurate.** The paragraph explains the Dual Process Attitude Model with implicit (preconception) and explicit (informed) attitudes.

*(Values are guided by attitude that influences behaviours)*

- **Mostly accurate.** The text says values are motivational goals that guide attitudes, which then influence behavior. The bracket is slightly simplified; more precisely, “values are motivational goals guided by attitudes, which influence behavior.”

---

### Paragraph 3

*(Evidence: Value-based Adoption Model [Explanation: Perception of cost and benefit affects adoption of new technology] - in two stages, #1 Initial adoption intention and #2 Post-adoption behaviours)*

- **Accurate.** The paragraph describes the VAM, emphasizing perceived value (cost-benefit) and its role in both initial and continued technology use.

---

### Research Questions

- **Accurate.** The three listed questions are clearly the study’s research questions.

## Part 4 – In-text Citations & the References List

### Purpose of this Part

When you are working on assignments in this course, you may borrow ideas from various sources including books, academic journals, newspapers, magazines, and websites. Remember to acknowledge the sources (who and when) in the body of your work (called “In-text Citations”) and provide a full list (who, when, what, where) of sources cited at the end of your work (called “End-of-text Citations”).

In this course, you are required to include in-text citations and an End-of-text Reference List using the **APA style (7th edition)**, instead of a bibliography, footnotes, or endnotes as end-of-text citations, in your assignments to avoid plagiarism.

---

## WHAT IS PLAGIARISM?

Plagiarism means a person presenting someone’s ideas as if they were their own. Common types of plagiarism include:

- Directly copying ideas without acknowledging the source
- Directly copying exact words or sentences without quotation marks and without acknowledging the source
- Submitting a previous assignment as if it was new to a course (even if you retake the same course)
- Translating texts from one language to another without acknowledging the source
- Rephrasing someone’s ideas without acknowledging the source
- Adding your own ideas to a source without acknowledging it
- Copying an output or text from Gen-AI tools without acknowledging such use

> **Source:** Adapted from the Guidelines on Academic Integrity for Students and Past Students, HKBU, 2025

Since this course promotes the use of Gen-AI tools as a learning partner, you are encouraged to use them throughout your learning. Below are some common scenarios of students using Gen-AI tools in this course.

## Generating In-text Citations and End-of-text Citations (or End-of-text Reference List)

- Verify all referenced sources to ensure their authenticity.
- Adhere to the latest version (i.e. 7th edition) of the APA referencing style.

---

## In Summary

The key principles to avoid plagiarism when using Gen-AI tools are:

- **Originality**: The more effort you put into drafting ideas, the less likely plagiarism will occur.
- **Source Acknowledgement**: Verify and cite sources properly in your work.
- **Human Judgement**: AI is a tool, not an author. So, you must critically review and modify outputs.

## Rhetorical Functions

The rhetorical functions of in-text citations are realised through communicative purposes, often signalled by strategic use of reporting verbs or signalling phrases.

### Communicative Purposes

| Purpose                    | Examples in the article of Hong et al., 2020 (Article A) |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Establishing Credibility:**<br>To demonstrate that your work is grounded in authoritative sources in order to boost your reliability as a writer | It has also been confirmed that perceived value has a mediating effect on the impact of innovative characteristics on behavioural intention (Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020; Plouffe et al., 2001). |
| **2. Guiding the Reader:**<br>To give your readers signals where to obtain full references from the end-of-text reference list for further reading | The literature reports that perceived value positively impacts Continuance intention to use (CIU) (Chen & Chen, 2010). For example, Singh and Sinha (2020) found that perceived usefulness can predict people’s CIU for a certain merchant. |

## Communicative Purposes

**Examples in the article of Hong et al., 2020 (Article A)**

---

### 3. Structuring Arguments

> To integrate borrowed material into your ideas while maintaining academic integrity

The results are consistent with previous studies (Albertsen et al., 2020; Lee, 2013), which proved that personal innovation had a positive relationship with perceived usefulness which accounts for the relationship between parents’ technological innovativeness and perceived value in this research.

---

### 5. Engaging in Scholarly Conversation

> To position your work within existing academic debates, showing awareness of various perspectives or contrasting views

A previous study found that innovation has a significant association with perceived usefulness (Lee, 2013; Lewis & Sambamurthy, 2003; Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020) explored the relationship between e-book use intention and personal innovation, and found that personal innovativeness was positively associated with perceived usefulness, and also had a higher use intention (Lee, 2013). Other researchers have found that consumers were more likely to feel the value of smartphones if they had high innovativeness about technology (Hong et al., 2017), while technological innovativeness was found to influence the perceived value of mobile payment services (Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020).

---

## Basic Rules

When you integrate an idea from a source into your work, you need to paraphrase the original wording and acknowledge the source (who and when) as in Activity 1.3:

One prominent educational application of facial recognition technology is campus security. This form of facial recognition is most prevalent in the US, where school shooting incidents have prompted school authorities to annually spend $2.7 billion on-campus security products and services (Doffman, 2018).

## Direct Quotations

Sometimes, you may directly quote or borrow ideas from a work by copying the exact wording from the original work.

If the quotation is **40 words or less** (which is called a ‘short’ quotation), you need to use double quotation marks (`“...”`) for the exact wording you cite, and add a page number after the quotation. For example:

> Kim et al. (2007) developed the Value-based Adoption Model (VAM) to illustrate that  
> “consumers' perception of the value of M-Internet is a principal determinant of adoption intention, and the other beliefs are mediated through perceived value” (p. 111).

**OR**

> Value-based Adoption Model (VAM) aims to show that “consumers' perception of the value of M-Internet is a principal determinant of adoption intention, and the other beliefs are mediated through perceived value” (Kim et al., 2007, p. 111).

If the quotation is **more than 40 words** (called a ‘long’ quotation), you need to indent the exact wording you cite, and add a page number after it. For example:

Kim et al. (2007) have observed that:

> Most adopters and users of traditional technologies are employees in an  
> organisational setting, where they use the technology for work purposes, and  
> the cost of mandatory adoption and usage is borne by the organisation. In  
> contrast, adopters and users of new ICT are individuals who play the dual  
> roles of technology user and service consumer. Most of them adopt and use  
> the new ICT for personal purposes, and the cost of voluntary adoption and  
> usage is borne by the individuals.  
> (p. 112)

## Common Types of In-text Citations

There are three common types of in-text citations, namely **author prominent**, **signal phrase**, and **information prominent**. Their rhetorical functions are listed in the table below.

---

| Type of In-text Citations      | Rhetorical Function                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Author-Prominent Citation** | **Example:**<br>“Wang and Teo (2020) argued that information quality and online service quality are positively associated with continuance intention and satisfaction, which have a positive association with perceived value.”<br><br>- **Highlights authority:** Emphasises the cited scholar’s credibility<br>- **Engages debate:** Positions the author as an active participant in a scholarly conversation<br>- **Clarifies perspective:** Signals the source’s stance |
| **2. Signal Phrase**              | **Example:**<br>“Other researchers have found that consumers were more likely to feel the value of smartphones if they had high innovativeness about technology (Hong et al., 2017), while technological innovativeness was found to influence the perceived value of mobile payment services (Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020).”<br><br>- **Synthesises evidence:** Groups sources to show consensus or trends<br>- **Smooths transitions:** Integrates citations naturally into the narrative<br>- **Redundancy avoidance:** Prevents repetitive use of "Author (Year)" structures |
| **3. Information-Prominent**      | **Example:**<br>“Moreover, perceived value was found to significantly affect users’ intentions (Li et al., 2018; Wang, 2014).”<br><br>- **Prioritises evidence:** Lets data/claims be the focus<br>- **Maintains flow:** Emphasises ideas rather than authors<br>- **Avoids author bias:** Presents established facts over authors’ personal views |

## Secondary Citations

A secondary citation (or “indirect citation”) refers to citing a source that you have not read directly but have found quoted or cited within a work you are reading. This is common in research because the original source may be inaccessible, or you want to refer to a well-known theory. You are highly encouraged to read the original (or primary) source to avoid misinterpretation by the author(s) who has/have cited the source.

For example, if you want to cite Wang and Teo’s (2020) (i.e. primary source) argument after reading Hong et al.’s article (i.e. secondary source), your citation may look like:

> It has been found that higher levels of information quality and online service quality correlate with increased continuance intention and user satisfaction, both of which further enhance perceived value (Wang & Teo, 2020, as cited in Hong et al., 2022).

**OR**

> Wang and Teo (2020) argued that higher levels of information quality and online service quality correlate with increased continuance intention and user satisfaction, both of which further enhance perceived value (as cited in Hong et al., 2022).

Please be reminded that when using a secondary citation, you need to paraphrase the idea taken from the secondary source. If you intend to cite the exact wording from the secondary

## End-of-text Reference List

You need to compile a reference list and place it at the end of your paper. In the reference list, arrange all the works you have cited in an alphabetical order according to the last name of the first author. If you have used a secondary source, only include it, but not the primary one, in the reference list since you have not read the primary one.

### Example:

Altemeyer, B. (1988). Enemies of freedom: Understanding right-wing authoritarianism. Jossey-Bass.

Arpaci, I. (2016). Understanding and predicting students’ intention to use mobile cloud storage services. *Computers in Human Behaviour*, 58(5), 150–157.
