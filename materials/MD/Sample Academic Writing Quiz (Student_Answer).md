### Sample Academic Writing Quiz Script – Student A  (Score: 80/100 = A-)

Facial recognition technology (FRT) is increasingly incorporated in schools, aiming to improve functions like security. This summary reports key arguments for and against the adoption of FRT in schools, from the perspectives of parents’ perceptions on the technology and privacy concerns about students.

The debate surrounding facial recognition in schools is fundamentally a conflict over its potential benefits brought to schools in the areas of safety versus its potential to infringe upon privacy and normalise surveillance (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020; Hong et al., 2022). On one hand, scholars like Hong et al. (2022) point out that, despite awareness of privacy issues, parents still support the continued use of FRT in schools as they prioritise its practical value and innovative features over potential risks. Conversely, others like Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) caution that the same technology poses serious social and ethical risks by potentially shifting schools toward authoritarian environments. They contend that it creates constant, inescapable surveillance that students cannot avoid, violating students’ consent. This makes a loss of privacy seem normal and can lead to pressure and control.

While facial recognition is perceived as worthwhile by certain stakeholders, concerns about surveillance without students’ consent highlight its controversial nature in educational settings.

Facial recognition technology is used more and more in schools all over the world. It helps with things like school security and checking students in automatically. In China, parents have different opinions about this technology. Some support it, but others worry about its effects. These articles talk about facial recognition in schools and show some of the good and bad sides of it (Hong et al., 2022; Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).

Article A says that many parents support facial recognition technology in elementary schools because they think it is useful and trustworthy. According to the research findings, the average score of parents’ perceived value is 3.919, which is much higher than the neutral level (3.000). The study shows parents gave high scores for how much value they see in the system and want to keep using it. Even though some parents worry about privacy, they still accept the technology, maybe because they believe it will make schools safer or easier to manage (Hong et al., 2022).

Article B says facial recognition is bad because there is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they share. Students don’t have freedom to choose to opt out. Maybe students don’t care, or it is not a big problem. The technology might just help schools be more organized (Andrejevic & Selwyn).

So, I think that Article A says parents like facial recognition because of its value, but Article B warns about problems and control, showing it is a debated issue (Hong et al., 2022; Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).
