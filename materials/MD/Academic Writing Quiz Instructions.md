## INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Write your Full Name (in English), Student Number, and Section Number in the space provided on Pages 2 and 4.**
2. **Use a pen or a pencil when writing your summary in the space provided on Pages 2 to 4. Write on EVERY line.**
3. **You must read the excerpts of TWO academic journal articles (Articles A and B) in the Question Paper.**
4. **Your task is to summarise, paraphrase and synthesise the main claims or arguments from the TWO excerpts on a given topic in NO MORE THAN 300 words. The topic will be given in the Question Paper with the excerpts.**
5. **Write in paragraph form and adopt the following general structure for your summary:**
    - **Introduction** (including background and a thesis statement)
    - **Body paragraph(s)** (including a topic sentence for each body paragraph)
    - **Conclusion**
6. **Use APA in-text citations (7th edition)\*** to acknowledge ideas from the article in your summary. However, the abstract should NOT be cited, as its purpose is to contextualise the excerpt. End-of-text citations or a reference list is NOT required.
7. **\*Examples:**
    - **Author-prominent style:** `[author’s surname] + [a reporting verb]`  
      *E.g.,*  
      > Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) report that facial recognition technologies are widely adopted in schools.
    - **Signal-phrase style:**  
      *E.g.,*  
      > According to Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020), facial recognition technologies are widely adopted in schools.  
      > According to some researchers, facial recognition technologies are widely adopted in schools (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).
    - **Information-prominent style:** `[cite the author’s name after the information or at the end of the sentence]`  
      *E.g.,*  
      > Facial recognition technologies are widely adopted in schools (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).
8. **You are NOT allowed to use any online or AI tools (including online dictionaries, paraphrasing or translation apps) during the test.**
9. **A glossary is included at the end of the excerpts. It provides definitions of specialised terms and jargon that are underlined in the text, regardless of whether they represent main ideas. You are NOT required to include any definitions of these terms in your writing.**
