## Slide 4
Common issues in ACE First DraftIn pairs, discuss how the following body paragraph can be improved.
Working from home decreases work family conflict, (paraphrase more) which in terms benefiting employees’ well being. Study shows that after 13 consecutive workdays, employees that were allowed to work from home on at most two days a week reported lowered work family conflict on days where they worked from home (Delanoeije & Verbruggen, 2020). Therefore, working from home is in fact beneficial for employees and is a worthwhile mode of work for employees.

## Slide 5
Common issues in ACE First DraftIn pairs, discuss how the following body paragraph can be improved.
Employees will suffer from less stress working from home, thereby raising their engagement and productivity at work. Remote work provides employees with greater autonomy on scheduling their tasks (De Spiegelaere et al., 2016 as cited in Delanoeije & Verbruggen, 2020) or freedom from potential interruptions by co-workers in a dense organizational atmosphere (Windeler et al., 2017 as cited in Delanoeije & Verbruggen, 2020). This evidence shows that telework offers diverse factors that help workers to lessen their stress so that they can enhance their work engagement and performance. Therefore, telework has positive aspect in terms of decreasing workers’ level of stress, which leads to boosting their efficiency.
Can elaborate a bit more. The topic sentence i.e. Point is missing.

Common issues in ACE First DraftIn pairs, compare the two paragraphs (counter-argument + refutation) Are chatbots suitable companions for young people?
Text 1  evidence from the counter-argument and the refutation should be cited from the given sources.
Some might argue the ready availability and human-like features of chatbots, such as their ability to showcase empathy, make them ideal companions for combating loneliness, especially among marginalised youth who lack emotional support. (point in the counter argument is a generalization. It needs to be backed up by evidence and explanation/ elaboration) However, this argument overlooks the potential of a reinforcing loop. For example, a teenager suffering from social anxiety may turn to a chatbot for comfort since AI never judges people. Over time, the teenager will withdraw from real-world interactions when relying solely on the chatbot for emotional support. As the in-person social skills weaken from disuse, face-to-face interactions become even more intimidating, trapping the teenager in a cycle of avoidance, ultimately deepening the teenager’s sense of alienation and loneliness.

### Text 2
Opponents might argue the ready availability and human-like features of chatbots, such as their ability to showcase empathy, make them ideal companions for combating loneliness, especially among marginalised youth who lack emotional support. Indeed, systematic reviews suggest that mental chatbots can deliver nonjudgmental, empathic support and reduce distress among young people who struggle with their social life; for example, college students using the Woebot chatbot experienced significant reductions in feelings of isolation within two weeks (Fitzpatrick et al. , 2017). By engaging in seeming interaction with these conversational agents designed to express empathy and build rapport, young people feel supported, which may help alleviate feelings of loneliness momentarily (Bickmore & Picard, 2005). However, this argument overlooks the long-term repercussions with prolonged use of AI chatbots i.e. intensified loneliness. More broadly, scholars warn that technologies which simulate empathy can entice users into “alone together” patterns that displace the messy, growth-producing work of human relationships (Bickmore & Picard, 2005). Notably, empirical work on socially anxious individuals finds that a preference for online social interaction predicts greater loneliness and functional impairment over time, suggesting that turning to AI-simulated interactions can exacerbate avoidance rather than resolve it (Caplan, 2007). For example, a teenager suffering from social anxiety may turn to a chatbot for comfort since AI never judges people. Over time, the teenager will withdraw from real-world interactions when relying solely on the chatbot for emotional support. As face-to-face interaction with another human becomes more daunting due to lack of practice, the sense of isolation and alienation deepens over time.
Are chatbots suitable companions for young people?

## Slide 8
Elements in a Concluding paragraphRead the concluding paragraph below and identify 3 structural elements (each colour signifies one structural element).
Despite demonstrating some resemblances to human-like conversations, chatbots can only at best simulate superficial features of supportive relationships or promote short-term improvements in mood. Chatbots exacerbate loneliness by replacing genuine human connections with empty interaction and fostering the false belief that emotional reciprocity with AI is possible. With the right intentions, chatbots can be useful assistive tools for young people, but in no way should they assume the role of a companion or as a substitute for genuine human interactions. Only by living with humans can young minds have a healthy development.

## Slide 16
### A sample response
The extract discusses lab-grown meat, which is made by growing animal cells in labs, to reduce the environmental impact of livestock farming (Context & Focus). The speaker argues that lab-grown meat should be promoted because it is a healthy and sustainable food choice(Stance and Point). For example, producers can adjust and fat content to match preferences of health-conscious consumers(Evidence-Example). As a result, this flexibility could make lab-grown meat more appealing to a wider consumer base, making it a more sustainable and healthier food choice (Explanation-Reasoning).
While lab-grown meat offers customisation benefits, it may not be as sustainable and healthy as claimed (refutation). Studies show that current production methods require significant energy inputs (Evidence-Example). For example, lab-grown meat generates 25-30% more carbon emissions than poultry farming (Evidence-Data). This is because maintaining germ-free lab conditions and the nutrients for cell growth requires a lot of electricity, which often comes from non-renewable energy sources (Explanation-Reasoning). Additionally, the long-term health effects remain uncertain since the use of growth factors to stimulate cell multiplication may have unforeseen consequences (Explanation-Reasoning). Therefore, lab-grown meat may not be as sustainable and healthy as it’s portrayed to be (Conclusion).
