### Example of a good synthesis:Identify a common theme to complete the topic sentence
Research on the barriers to second language acquisition has primarily focused on _________________.   Building on Lenneberg’s (1967) theory of a critical period of language acquisition, Johnson and Newport (1988) tested Lenneberg’s idea in the context of second language acquisition. Their research seemed to confirm that young learners acquire a second language more easily than older learners. Recent research has considered other potential barriers to language acquisition. Schepens et al. (2022) have revealed that the difficulties of learning a second language at an older age are compounded by dissimilarity between a learner’s first language and the language they aim to acquire. The more the first and target language differ, the greater the challenges in acquiring the target language.

## Slide 14
### Synthesize the two excerpts below
### Excerpt 1 (Seng et al., 2021)
“As a result, there is growing discussion in the media about the use of FR in everyday life. Recent news indicates that people are in favour of using FR when retailers have to prevent shoplifting (West, 2018) or to help a celebrity identify her stalkers (Castro, 2019). On the other hand, there are concerns about the use of FR, including its biased accuracy. For example, the evaluation of three commercial gender classification systems indicate that darker-skinned females are the most mis-classified group, with error rates of up to 34.7%, while the maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8% (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018).”
### Excerpt 2 (Caines, 2021)
“A survey conducted by Pew Research Centre focussed on people’s trust in law enforcement agencies regarding the use of facial recognition to identify suspected criminals (Smith, 2019). It found that the majority of people in UK want the government to impose restrictions on law enforcement agencies with the use of FR (Ada Lovelace Institute, 2019). These surveys (Castro and McLaughlin, 2019; Ada Lovelace Institute, 2019; Smith, 2019) examined trust in law enforcement agencies with the use of FR. However, there is still a large gap in understanding users’ perceptions of FR in everyday life.”
