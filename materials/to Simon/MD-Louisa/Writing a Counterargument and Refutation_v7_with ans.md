## Slide 3
### Example of a three-paragraph structure
Although facial recognition technology (FRT) is becoming more common in schools worldwide, this paper argues that it is not advisable for schools to adopt FRT on campus due to possible violation of students’ privacy.
FRT intrudes on students’ privacy since the “informed consent” is not observed (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020). For instance, the facial recognition systems in operation in schools scan all students' faces in classrooms and corridors to function regardless of whether or not a student has opted out (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020). In other words, even if students can choose to opt out, the system cannot avoid scanning everyone, making "opt-in" or "opt-out" options impractical. As a result, this violates the principle of “informed consent” because students are not allowed to choose not to participate (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).
Some opponents claim that even if facial recognition systems scan all students by default, an “opt-out” mechanism still allows them to later remove their data or disable tracking, thereby preserving the principle of informed consent. However, while “opt-out” may allow data removal after scanning, the initial collection still violates privacy, as students have no rights to avoid being scanned in the first place. In fact, true consent requires the ability to refuse participation entirely, not just after the initial scanning.

## Slide 4
In pairs, discuss the following questions.
In the introductory paragraph, what is the writer’s stance?
In the introductory paragraph, what is/ are the supporting reason(s)?
Identify two components of the thesis statement.

---

## Slide 5
In pairs, discuss the following questions.
In the introductory paragraph, what is the writer’s stance?
The writer essentially objects the implementation of FRT on campus.
In the introductory paragraph, what is/ are the supporting reason(s)?
Possible violation of students’ privacy.
Identify two components of the thesis statement.
Clear stance on the argumentative topic and a supporting reason which will be elaborated in the subsequent two paragraphs.

---

## Slide 6
In pairs, discuss the following questions.
What is the relation between the 2nd paragraph and the 3rd paragraph?

---

## Slide 7
In pairs, discuss the following questions.
What is the relation between the 2nd paragraph and the 3rd paragraph?
The 3rd paragraph initially presents a counter-argument to the point made in the previous paragraph, i.e. FRT on campus lacks informed consent. Further into the 3rd paragraph, this counter-argument is then refuted by the notion that FRT still violates true consent when students are denied their rights to refuse to participate in the first place during initial scanning. This refutation indirectly strengthens the point in the 2nd paragraph by disproving the counterargument which challenges it.

## Slide 8
Why write counter-arguments and refutations?
### Counter-argument: an opposing viewpoint
Refutation: Your response to the counter-argument showing why the counterargument is invalid or inferior
### Counterargument and refutation
### Refutation
### Counterargument

---

## Slide 9
Why write counter-arguments and refutations?
Both counter-arguments and refutations enhance the persuasiveness of an argumentative essay by demonstrating an in-depth knowledge of viewpoints which run counter to  your own.

### Comparing Two Rebuttals (Counterargument + Refutation)
1. Annotate where the counterargument ends and the refutation begins in each example.
### Example 1
Essay topic: ‘Urbanisation is a curse.’ Do you agree or disagree?
The author’s stance: Urbanisation is NOT a curse.
However, some people are convinced that urbanization is actually a curse as it accelerates the effects of greenhouse gasses (GHG). They believe that countless trees have been cut down in the cities for building houses in order to accommodate a great influx of people from the suburban areas, and as a result, GHG continue to increase to a level that exacerbates the already dire situation. Although this argument sounds valid at a glance, it does not remain tenable upon closer scrutiny. Urbanization is a blessing as it attracts a lot of talents to work in the cities, which benefits the GDP. The talent will stay in cities where the facilities and economic development are much better than those in rustic areas. With the increased workforce, there will be a growth in GDP, and hence it could be argued that urbanization is actually a blessing, not a curse.

## Slide 12
### Comparing Two Rebuttals (Counterargument + Refutation)
1. Annotate where the counterargument ends and the refutation begins in each example.
### Example 2
Essay topic: Should the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) focus more on the needs of the elderly in their urban planning?
The author’s stance: The URA SHOULD focus more on the needs of the elderly in their urban planning.
The Urban Renewal Authority supporters may argue that research findings indicate that the health of the elderly in redeveloped urban areas has in fact improved. As evidence, they may point to a clear correlation between increased density and improved health in these areas (Kandt et al., 2017). This seems to indicate that the intensity of land use in these locations gives the elderly improved access to different community facilities, along with reduced commute time due to the proximity and variety of available services. The impetus for this change seems echoed by elderly Kwun Tong residents who expressed a preference for “proximity to amenities and the effective use of space” (Yung et al., 2016, p. 9). Undoubtedly, on the surface, such quantitative data presents a compelling case that intensity of land use correlates with improved health, but in reality this correlation likely merely reflects the displacement of the poor elderly population in those gentrified locations by incoming wealthier residents. It would thus stand to reason that displacing the poorer elderly population with a wealthier one would produce better health outcomes. Yet, this correlation fails to take socioeconomic factors into consideration. A telling example of this is the MTR’s transit-oriented model of development, which creates a highly dense and centralized residential area that primarily benefits wealthier residents (Wang, 2022). This approach clearly ignores the interest of the local socio-economically disadvantaged elderly residents.

## Slide 17
### Comparing Two Rebuttals
2. How do the authors signal this transition (from the counterargument to the refutation) in each example?
Example 1: The author somewhat acknowledges the apparent validity of the counterargument (i.e. CONCESSION), but then concludes that it is in fact not valid by proceeding to introduce the refutation (i.e. Construction of Refutation).
Example 2: The author initially makes a concession to acknowledge the apparent validity of the argument (i.e. CONCESSION), but then uses the contrastive conjunction ‘but’ to introduce the refutation (i.e. Construction of Refutation).

3. What is the function of the last sentence in both examples?
Example 1:
The last sentence directly consolidates the thesis statement.

In groups of 3, identify the 4Cs in the following counter-argument and refutation paragraph with different colours.Stance:Sports gambling should be fully legalized as its benefits outweigh its harms.
Opponents of sports betting has long been lamenting that legalization of sports betting has increased pathological gambling. According to Kongsvik (1994), help-line director for the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling, the centre recorded a fair amount of sports gamblers seeking help, which rarely happened before sports betting became lawful. Admittedly, it is logical that an increased number of sports gamblers after legalization is likely to aggravate pathological gambling. Logical as it may sound, the argument ______________________. According to a survey on gambling behaviour conducted by Lark (1995), the vast majority of pathological gamblers (over 90%) are more willing to seek help through official channels when they are involved in a lawful activity without any stigma, which explains the correlation between legalized sports betting and an increased number of sports gamblers seeking help. Contrary to popular belief, legalization of sports betting helps reduce pathological gambling by opening the door for legitimate harm reduction efforts.

Exercise 2 – Which of the following is a valid refutation? Why?
B. In arguing against reducing students’ homework load, some adults argue that tasking teenagers with more take-home assignments will keep them busy and thus out of trouble. One has to concede that students who have a lot of homework will naturally have less time and energy for trouble. However, according to the statistics reported by the Department of Justice in California (2016), the vast majority of students who committed crimes (87%) are the ones who invariably played truant and did not bother to do the assigned homework. Contrary to popular belief, more schoolwork will not reduce crimes committed by these youngsters, who are habitual school absentees.

One has to concede that students who have a lot of homework will naturally have less time and energy for trouble. However, more schoolwork can create more stress, which may undermine the emotional well-being of adolescents. According to a famous study by developmental psychologist Paul Denver (1986), teenagers who are constantly loaded with lots of schoolwork are more vulnerable to stress and anxiety compared to those with less homework. Contrary to popular belief, less homework will promote youngsters’ well-being.
Thesis statement:
Teenagers should have less homework for better development.

## Slide 40
### Comparing Two Rebuttals
3. Is the counterargument and/or refutation persuasive in each example? Why or why not?
Example 1:
Both the counterargument and refutation lack research data or findings in their support to make it more convincing. They also both make assumptions and generalizations, which detracts from the overall persuasiveness. The biggest issue, however, is that the refutation is a ‘red herring’ fallacy. That is to say, it shifts the focus and does not directly address the idea in the counterargument (GHG and GDP are related but separate issues).
Example 2:
The counterargument seems convincing at a surface level but due to the writer’s use of hedging, the reader will likely be somewhat skeptical of its validity. The refutation directly addresses the counterargument and argues effectively that the counterargument is based on a superficial point of view which fails to take other relevant factors into account.
