One key reason mindfulness increases employees’ productivity is that it helps them remain focussed on their tasks. Findings from systematic reviews have shown that mindfulness is associated with a decrease in stress caused by distractions and overthinking. This decrease can then lead to gains in thinking ability, motivation, and attention, as well as executive functioning in the workplace. In one specific case, a company that offered brief daily mindfulness sessions found that employees reported fewer interruptions and completed routine tasks more quickly with fewer errors. This doesn’t surprise me because when workers notice their mind wandering and gently bring it back, they waste less time ruminating and switch back to the task sooner. Besides this, mindfulness practice can be done in short sessions between meetings, so employees can reset their attention without leaving their desks. With something like deadline pressure, even after a one-minute breathing exercise, a person might feel calmer and prioritise better. This suggests that the improved focus and self-regulation from mindfulness can lead to faster task completion, higher-quality output, and more efficient teamwork.

Exercise 2 – Which of the following is a valid refutation? Why?
B. In arguing against reducing students’ homework load, some adults argue that tasking teenagers with more take-home assignments will keep them busy and thus out of trouble. One has to concede that students who have a lot of homework will naturally have less time and energy for trouble. However, according to the statistics reported by the Department of Justice in California (2016), the vast majority of students who committed crimes (87%) are the ones who invariably played truant and did not bother to do the assigned homework. Contrary to popular belief, more schoolwork will not reduce crimes committed by these youngsters, who are habitual school absentees.
A. In arguing against reducing students’ homework load, some adults argue that tasking teenagers with more take-home assignments will keep them busy and thus out of trouble. One has to concede that students who have a lot of homework will naturally have less time and energy for trouble. However, more schoolwork can create more stress, which may undermine the emotional well-being of adolescents. According to a famous study by developmental psychologist Paul Denver (1986), teenagers who are constantly loaded with lots of schoolwork are more vulnerable to stress and anxiety compared to those with less homework. Contrary to popular belief, less homework will promote youngsters’ well-being.
Thesis statement:
Teenagers should have less homework for better development.

## Slide 20
Argument of the speaker in the listening. Read the 4 rebuttals debunking the point. Identify a refutation strategy in each rebuttal.
Point: ChatGPT is a suitable tool for university students because it enhances their learning experience through immediate access to information and diverse perspectives.
Evidence: For example, a study conducted by the University of California found that students using AI tools like ChatGPT for research reported increased efficiency in gathering information and improved clarity in understanding complex topics.
Explanation: This evidence shows that students can quickly access a wide range of information, enabling them to explore different viewpoints and grasp intricate subjects. With an AI assistant that can explain concepts in various ways, students can tailor their learning to their needs, fostering deeper understanding.
Link: In summary, ChatGPT's ability to provide instant information and varied insights makes it an invaluable resource for university students, significantly enhancing their educational experience.

## Slide 21
ChatGPT is a suitable tool for university students because it enhances their learning experience through immediate access to information and diverse perspectives.
### Rebuttal 1
Point: While ChatGPT offers immediate access to information, this immediacy can undermine the learning experience for university students by hindering the development of critical thinking and deeper understanding.
Evidence: A study from MIT's Media Lab found that students using ChatGPT for essay writing showed lower brain engagement and underperformed in cognitive assessments compared to those using search engines or no AI assistance. Additionally, another study indicated that Internet searchers retained less new knowledge.
Explanation: This evidence highlights that readily available answers can deter students from engaging in the effortful thinking necessary for true learning. Over-reliance on ChatGPT may reduce critical analysis and problem-solving skills, making students passive recipients of information rather than active learners, and potentially masking learning deficits.
Link: Therefore, the immediate access to information provided by ChatGPT, while seemingly beneficial, can be detrimental to university students by hindering essential cognitive skills and undermining the depth of their learning.

---

## Slide 22
### Rebuttal 2
Point: While ChatGPT may enhance learning in some aspects, its effectiveness are inconsistent across different uses, and over-reliance can undermine the learning experience by hindering the development of critical thinking. ChatGPT studies often only excludes more complex tasks like critical thinign and creative thinking.
Evidence: A study from MIT's Media Lab found that students using ChatGPT for essay writing demonstrated lower brain engagement and consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels compared to those using search engines or no AI assistance. Moreover, studies show that over-dependence on AI can result in reduced critical thinking and problem-solving skills, disengagement in learning [2], and a decline in creativity.
Explanation: This evidence challenges the notion that the efficiency and clarity reported in the University of California study are universal benefits. The MIT study suggests that using ChatGPT may lead to less cognitive effort and engagement, potentially hindering deeper understanding.
Link: Therefore, while some studies suggest benefits from using ChatGPT, the limitations of this evidence, coupled with research highlighting the potential for reduced critical thinking, bias, and over-reliance, indicate that ChatGPT can undermine the learning experience for university students, rather than universally enhancing it.
ChatGPT is a suitable tool for university students because it enhances their learning experience through immediate access to information and diverse perspectives.

## Slide 23
### Rebuttal 3
Point: Whether ChatGPT enhances college students’ learning experience through immediate access to information is not a binary issue but depends on how it is used, revealing a false dichotomy.
Evidence: ChatGPT can enhance learning when used for brainstorming or summarization, but can hinder it if relied upon for generating entire essays. A 2025 HEPI survey showed that while 88% of students use AI for assessments mainly for explanation and summarization, concerns about cheating and inaccuracies deter responsible use. Additionally, structured integration within pedagogical models can make its impact more positive.
Explanation: This evidence illustrates that ChatGPT's effectiveness varies based on student intent and application. When used constructively, it supports skill development; when misused, it impedes critical thinking and academic integrity.
Link: Thus, labeling ChatGPT as simply "suitable" or "unsuitable" overlooks the nuanced role of its application, emphasizing the need for responsible integration to maximize benefits while minimizing risks.
ChatGPT is a suitable tool for university students because it enhances their learning experience through immediate access to information and diverse perspectives.

## Slide 24
### Rebuttal 4
While ChatGPT can summarize information, it may not be a one-size-fits-all tool to enhance learning, as different cognitive skills may warrant more specialized tool designed for that purpose. Better alternatives and supplementary tools should be used alongside ChatGPT.
Evidence: Tools like QuillBot and SciSummary are specifically designed for accurate summarization, often outperforming ChatGPT. Additionally, research management tools like Zotero help students engage more deeply with sources and develop their analytical skills.
Explanation: Although ChatGPT provides summaries, relying solely on it may limit critical thinking development. Using specialized summarization and research management tools encourages more active engagement with material, leading to better comprehension.
Link: Therefore, while ChatGPT's summarization feature is useful, students can enhance their learning more effectively by utilizing more specialized tools that promote deeper understanding and critical analysis.
ChatGPT is a suitable tool for university students because it enhances their learning experience through immediate access to information and diverse perspectives.

## Slide 29
### A sample response
The extract discusses lab-grown meat, which is made by growing animal cells in labs, to reduce the environmental impact of livestock farming (Context & Focus). The speaker argues that lab-grown meat should be promoted because it is a healthy and sustainable food choice(Stance and Point). For example, producers can adjust and fat content to match preferences of health-conscious consumers(Evidence-Example). As a result, this flexibility could make lab-grown meat more appealing to a wider consumer base, making it a more sustainable and healthier food choice (Explanation-Reasoning).
While lab-grown meat offers customisation benefits, it may not be as sustainable and healthy as claimed (refutation). Studies show that current production methods require significant energy inputs (Evidence-Example). For example, lab-grown meat generates 25-30% more carbon emissions than poultry farming (Evidence-Data). This is because maintaining germ-free lab conditions and the nutrients for cell growth requires a lot of electricity, which often comes from non-renewable energy sources (Explanation-Reasoning). Additionally, the long-term health effects remain uncertain since the use of growth factors to stimulate cell multiplication may have unforeseen consequences (Explanation-Reasoning). Therefore, lab-grown meat may not be as sustainable and healthy as it’s portrayed to be (Conclusion).
