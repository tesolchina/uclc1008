### 6 building blocks of the Toulmin Argumentation Model
### Claim
### Warrant
### Reason/ Grounds
### Backing
### Rebuttal
### Qualifier

---

## Slide 10
### Claim
### The viewpoint you are trying to convince others
### A debatable statement
E.g. Transgender women should NOT be granted access to a female bathroom.

---

## Slide 11
### Reason/ Grounds
### The “because” part of an argument
### Justification of your viewpoint
E.g. Transgender women should NOT be granted access to a female bathroom because they are not females.

---

## Slide 12
### Warrant
### Underlying assumptions and principles that justifies
### Justification of your viewpoint
### Often related to concepts like fairness, rights and justice
E.g. One’s gender should be decided by one’s physiological attributes, not just one’s own preference.

---

## Slide 13
### Backing
### Warrants are often questioned or doubted
### Backing supports and proves the warrants and assumptions you are making
E.g. Having gender identity decided by one’s physiological attributes promotes safety and stability in the society.
### Backing

## Slide 14
### Rebuttal
### Rebuttal
### The “even though” part of an argument
### 2 parts: Counter-argument + Response
### Counter-argument: An acknowledgment of the opposing view
Response: 3 ways to respond: concede or agree with the opposing view; refute or prove the opposing view wrong; compromise or modify claim to meet part way
E.g. Counter-argument (opposing view):
Even though transgender women with male attributes might increase the risk of sexual assault if they are allowed to use the female bathroom, not all transgender women will pose a safety threat to females in the ladies’ bathroom.
Response (compromise or modify claim):To protect the rights of both biological and transgender women, only transgender women who have undergone surgery are allowed entry to a female bathroom.

## Slide 15
### Qualifier
### A way of Hedging
### Words that decrease the degree of certainty by defining when and how the claim is true
### Implies the claim may not be true under all circumstances
### Help avoid sweeping statements and challenges
### Words used for hedging: probably, could, often, possibly
E.g. Transgender women who have undergone sex reassignment surgery (SRS) should be granted access to a female bathroom.
### Qualifier
