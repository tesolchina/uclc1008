## Slide 8
Compare the original passage with Passages A and B. Then answer the following questions.
### Original _Quote________
“But the issue was about more than Facial Recognition Technology; it exposed a critical turning point as the power, sophistication and potential exploitation of technology outpaces what users, regulators, or even its creators expected or seem prepared to handle” (Roose & Kang, 2018, para.11).
### Passage B: Paraphrase
The issue made it apparent that the expectations of creators, regulators and users have been rapidly eclipsed by technology in general, not only Facial Recognition Technology. Such Technologies now extend beyond what these parties are able to manage, due to their immense influence, potential for exploitation and sophistication.
### Passage A: Summary
The quote highlights that the challenges posed by facial recognition technology reflect a broader concern: the rapid advancement and potential misuse of technology surpass the preparedness of users, regulators, and even its developers.

---

## Slide 9
Passages A and B are derived from the original quote. What are the skills used in writing Passage A and B respectively? How do you arrive at this conclusion.
Passage A demonstrates summarizing skills whereas Passage B showcases paraphrasing skills. Passage A is a shortened, condensed version of the original quote and Passage B retains most of the ideas in the quote with different wordings.
2. What is the fundamental difference between Passage B and Passage A?
A paraphrase rewords an idea without changing its meaning while a summary simply retains the most general or essential meaning with excessive details removed.
Compare the original passage with Passages A and B. Then answer the following questions.

## Slide 10
3. What is missing from Passage A and B? Correct the error by putting the information back in both passages.
To avoid plagiarism, an in-text citation is needed when you borrow ideas from another source.
Passage A:
The quote highlights that the challenges posed by facial recognition technology reflect a broader concern: the rapid advancement and potential misuse of technology surpass the preparedness of users, regulators, and even its developers (Roose & Kang, 2018).
Passage B:
The issue made it apparent that the expectations of creators, regulators and users have been rapidly eclipsed by technology in general, not only Facial Recognition Technology. Such Technologies now extend beyond what these parties are able to manage, due to their immense influence, potential for exploitation and sophistication (Roose & Kang, 2018).
Compare the original passage with Passages A and B. Then answer the following questions.

## Slide 27
Rosebrock (2020, as cited in Caines, 2021) points out that while most websites explicitly prohibit scraping, or using automated web browsing for accessing content, there is a lack of legal regulation which has likely resulted from low awareness and an inadequate understanding of scraping (Caines, 2021).
