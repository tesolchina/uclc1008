## Slide 6
### Example of a summary
Although the regulations and policies of private companies appear to protect users’ privacy, most companies default to an “opt-in” method, and users must proactively seek to “opt out” of their data usage. Each policy also seemingly includes language that appears to ensure users’ data is “safe,” but then speaks in overbroad terms and fails to define important words and phrases, such as “metadata.” It is also concerning that privacy policies, such as that of Shutterfly’s, now protects the privacy of California consumers differently than it protects the privacy of other consumers. The lack of consistency and clarity for users further illustrates the importance and need for federal regulations surrounding facial recognition technology.” (McClellan, 2020, p.371)
According to McClellan (2020), while some private companies’ facial recognition policies claim to protect users’ privacy and personal data, the terms and definitions that they utilise are vague, inconsistent, and sometimes missing, necessitating stricter government regulations.

## Slide 11
Read and analyze the two passages below. Answer the questions that follow.
Passage 1:
Concerns about privacy violations have been raised by Author A (2023). Additionally, Author B (2022) and Author C (2017) highlight threats to student autonomy associated with this technology. Author D (2021) points out systemic biases in algorithmic surveillance. Author E (2023) argue that the potential of FRT to enhance students’ safety justifies its adoption despite these ethical concerns.

## Slide 12
Read and analyze the two passages below. Answer the questions that follow.
Passage 2:
The adoption of facial recognition technology (FRT) in schools has sparked significant moral debate, with scholars raising concerns about privacy violations (Author A, 2023), threats to student autonomy (Author B, 2022; Author C, 2017), and systemic biases in algorithmic surveillance (Author D, 2021). However, Author E (2023) challenges these objections, arguing that FRT’s potential to enhance students’ safety justifies its adoption despite ethical concerns.

## Slide 14
Read and analyze the two syntheses below. Answer the questions that follow.
Which one is a better synthesis? Justify your choice with reasons.
In Passage 1, the paragraph shifts from one idea to another drastically without comparing across different sources, the author simply describes the content source by source.
In Passage 2, the author indicates the relationships different sources. Rather than simply describing the content of the sources in order, the author uses transitions (like “However") and makes the relationship between the sources evident.
Passage 2 is a better written synthesis.

## Slide 15
2. In Passage 2, which sentence articulates a common theme discussed in all articles?
Synthesis 2:
The adoption of facial recognition technology (FRT) in schools has sparked significant moral debate, with scholars raising concerns about privacy violations (Author A, 2023), threats to student autonomy (Author B, 2022; Author C, 2017), and systemic biases in algorithmic surveillance (Author D, 2021). However, Author E (2023) challenges these objections, arguing that FRT’s potential to enhance students’ safety justifies its adoption despite ethical concerns.

### You look for areas where your sources agree or disagree
### Show the relationship using signposting words
