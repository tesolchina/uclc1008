### Elements of an Introduction
Does the role of AI online pose potential detrimental effects for users?
### Parallel structure when presenting the supporting reasons in the thesis statement
As the time people spend online increases, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as burgeoning research areas. User data is fed directly into the design of algorithms, enabling companies to provide content customized for individual users (Bail, 2021). Some view this as a positive development, arguing that algorithms can provide users with a confidence afforded by their technological nature and mathematical precision (Sharabi, 2021). This essay, however, posits that the nature of their design is ultimately financially-driven, and thus the primary function is to manipulate users in order to increase companies’ profits. It is argued that this manipulation is essentially harmful, which manifests in the reinforcement of echo chambers, a reduction in the quality of information online, and the outsourcing of significant personal decisions to these algorithms.
### Background
### Summarise the main opposing viewpoints regarding the issue
### Thesis Statement i.e. Stance + Supporting reasons (use parallel structure)

## Slide 8
Identify different functions of a body paragraph. Each colour represents a distinct function.
### 1st Body Paragraph
Leaving social media does not simply mean going back to the way things were – it means giving up their  way of life. Sara Rendon, briefly left social media after she was threatened by extremists for  supporting her husband’s right to bear arms. However, she soon came back to Twitter and Facebook  because she felt that they were the only way for her to get regular updates about her siblings, nieces, and  nephews who lived far away. Other people interviewed for this book who took temporary  leaves of absence from social media reported similar fears about missing out. These examples  show that quitting social media can incur fear and anxiety among the users as a result of the disconnect  from social media. Often this fear extends beyond friends and family members and into  the social media communities where people spread information about their interests, hobbies, or fields of employment.
### 2nd Body Paragraph
While some people are sucked back in because they miss some type of social connection, others are  pushed back onto platforms by friends, family members, or colleagues. Many people…

Identify different functions of a body paragraph. Each colour represents a distinct function.
### 1st Body Paragraph
Leaving social media does not simply mean going back to the way things were – it means giving up their  way of life. (Point) Sara Rendon, briefly left social media after she was threatened by extremists for  supporting her husband’s right to bear arms. However, she soon came back to Twitter and Facebook  because she felt that they were the only way for her to get regular updates about her siblings, nieces, and  nephews who lived far away. Other people interviewed for this book who took temporary  leaves of absence from social media reported similar fears about missing out. (Evidence/ Example) These examples  show that quitting social media can incur fear and anxiety among the users as a result of the disconnect  from social media. (Explanation) Often this fear extends beyond friends and family members and into  the social media communities where people spread information about their interests, hobbies, or fields of employment.

### █║ Developing a Well-Structured Body Paragraph (P.87)
Each of the sentences of your body paragraphs for the Argumentative Essay (AE) should perform a specific  function in support of the overall main idea of the paragraph, and less directly, in support of the thesis of  the essay. Within the body paragraphs, the sentences will typically perform the following functions:
### Organization
### Very clear structure at the paragraph level (P.E.E.L.)
The argumentation in the body paragraph is highly critical, analytical, logical, and well-supported by relevant evidence and elaboration

. Throughout history humans have been infatuated with spectacles and stories. While fascination with spectacles has not deteriorated and is a quintessential part of consumer culture (Kozinets et al., 2004), the party telling the story has now changed. Whereas traditional media companies controlled how and which stories were presented to the public previously, with new media anyone can become a storyteller. This disruption of power, where power can immediately change hands to those of the consumer, and where the spectacle society rewards bizarre, outrageous, and inane behavior like cat videos or terrorist attacks, casts a negative outlook on consumer behavior.

This is especially important given that the platforms themselves are increasing in addictive potential due to the use of adaptive algorithms. Imagine if every time one bought coffee from their neighborhood café, the coffee, unbeknownst to the customer, spiked in addictiveness (Bhargava & Velasquez, 2021). This, obviously, would be troubling. But it might be made less bad if the café were to tell you that it would increase the addictiveness of your coffee each time you purchased coffee there. Tech firms, similarly, owe it to their users to make it clear that they are employing the users’ usage data in ways that will not only make the experience better, but may also make the platform more addictive.

### Presenting strong evidence supporting your argument
### PEEL(P. 91)
Common types of evidence include facts, data/statistics, examples, quotes, anecdotes, and research findings. To construct a strong argument, make sure you also check the credibility of the source and evaluate the strength of your chosen evidence. If you incorporate external evidence, remember that you should properly acknowledge the source of such information.  In-text citations

### Activity 10 (P. 93)
Social media reactions often create a sense of emotional exhaustion or burnout in the employees. Experiencing strong emotions can be a source of stress that can trigger physical reaction in the body. For example, a strong anger reaction can increase blood pressure (Dimsdale et al., 1986), heart rate (Brosschot & Thayer, 2003), adrenaline (Funkenstein, 1955), cortisol (Moons, Eisenberger, & Taylor, 2010), and muscle tension (Ax, 1953), among other responses. Emotions may even have a pervasive effect on mood (Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996).

### Activity 10 (P. 93)
Social media reactions often create a sense of emotional exhaustion or burnout in the employees. Experiencing strong emotions can be a source of stress that can diminish our capacity for emotional resilience. For example, a strong anger reaction can increase blood pressure (Dimsdale et al., 1986), heart rate (Brosschot & Thayer, 2003), adrenaline (Funkenstein, 1955), cortisol (Moons, Eisenberger, & Taylor, 2010), and muscle tension (Ax, 1953), among other responses. Emotions may even have a pervasive effect on mood (Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996). These reactions consume energy, which could otherwise be spent on work. As energy stores decrease, employees are likely to experience the exhaustion associated with job burnout.
