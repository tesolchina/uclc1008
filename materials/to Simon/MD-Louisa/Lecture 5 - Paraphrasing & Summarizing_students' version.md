“But the issue was about more than Facial Recognition Technology; it exposed a critical turning point as the power, sophistication and potential exploitation of technology outpaces what users, regulators, or even its creators expected or seem prepared to handle” (Roose & Kang, 2018, para.11).
### Passage B: Paraphrase
The issue made it apparent that the expectations of creators, regulators and users have been rapidly eclipsed by technology in general, not only Facial Recognition Technology. Such Technologies now extend beyond what these parties are able to manage, due to their immense influence, potential for exploitation and sophistication.
### Passage A: Summary
The quote highlights that the challenges posed by facial recognition technology reflect a broader concern: the rapid advancement and potential misuse of technology surpass the preparedness of users, regulators, and even its developers.
