### Example of a summary
Although the regulations and policies of private companies appear to protect users’ privacy, most companies default to an “opt-in” method, and users must proactively seek to “opt out” of their data usage. Each policy also seemingly includes language that appears to ensure users’ data is “safe,” but then speaks in overbroad terms and fails to define important words and phrases, such as “metadata.” It is also concerning that privacy policies, such as that of Shutterfly’s, now protects the privacy of California consumers differently than it protects the privacy of other consumers. The lack of consistency and clarity for users further illustrates the importance and need for federal regulations surrounding facial recognition technology.” (McClellan, 2020, p.371)
According to McClellan (2020), while some private companies’ facial recognition policies claim to protect users’ privacy and personal data, the terms and definitions that they utilise are vague, inconsistent, and sometimes missing, necessitating stricter government regulations.

## Slide 10
Read and analyze the two passages below. Answer the questions that follow.
Passage 1:
Lenneberg (1967) theorized that language acquisition could occur only within a critical period of development between infancy and puberty. Johnson and Newport (1988) have researched the capability of young people to learn a second language. Their findings suggest that young learners acquire a second language more easily than older learners. Schepens et al. (2022) have found that age and language dissimilarity play a role in adults’ abilities to acquire a second language.
Passage 2:
Research on the barriers to second language acquisition has primarily focused on age-related difficulties. Building on Lenneberg’s (1967) theory of a critical period of language acquisition, Johnson and Newport (1988) tested Lenneberg’s idea in the context of second language acquisition. Their research seemed to confirm that young learners acquire a second language more easily than older learners. Recent research has considered other potential barriers to language acquisition. Schepens et al. (2022) have revealed that the difficulties of learning a second language at an older age are compounded by dissimilarity between a learner’s first language and the language they aim to acquire.

Synthesizing Sources – What is a synthesis?
You are engaging in synthesis when:
### You identify a common theme/ topic across different sources
### You look for areas where your sources agree or disagree
### Show the relationship using signposting words
In other words, a synthesis looks for relationships between sources and draws conclusions.
