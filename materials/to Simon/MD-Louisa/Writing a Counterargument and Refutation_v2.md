Identify a supporting reason, a counter-argument, and a refutation in the following paragraphs?
Thesis statement:
Facial recognition should be implemented because of A, B and C.
Text A:
Opponents may argue that implementing facial recognition in a school setting may lead to problems of consent. Schools often deploy facial recognition to capture students’ face to make sure that their students are aligned with the requirement. Such practice often makes students and parents feel unreasonably treated. This raised inadequacy of any promise of ‘informed consent’ regarding school facial recognition systems because most of the schools enforce dress code that prevents students’ faces from being covered by hair, hood or other obstruction. This makes it hard for students to obscure their face from surveillance camera …

Identify a supporting reason, a counter-argument, and a refutation in the following paragraphs?
Thesis statement:
Facial recognition should be implemented because of A, B and C.
Text B:
Logical as this argument may seem, the school facial recognition system is regulated by controlled consent. Under the international setting, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) prohibits collection of biometric information without prior notification to users and consent from them …
Text C:
One of the major reasons to support implementing facial recognition technology is to enhance national security. The Indiana State Police solved a murder within 20 minutes of deploying facial recognition. In the case, a bystander recorded the video, which captured the perpetrator’s face who stabbed another man during the fight in the park ….

In groups of 3, identify the 4Cs in the following counter-argument and refutation paragraph with different colours.Stance:Sports gambling should be fully legalized as its benefits outweigh its harms.
Opponents of sports betting has long been lamenting that legalization of sports betting has increased pathological gambling. According to Kongsvik (1994), help-line director for the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling, the centre recorded a fair amount of sports gamblers seeking help, which rarely happened before sports betting became lawful. Admittedly, it is logical that an increased number of sports gamblers after legalization is likely to aggravate pathological gambling. Logical as it may sound, the argument seems to rest on a confusion of causality and correlation. According to a survey on gambling behaviour conducted by Lark (1995), the vast majority of pathological gamblers (over 90%) are more willing to seek help through official channels when they are involved in a lawful activity without any stigma, which explains the correlation between legalized sports betting and an increased number of sports gamblers seeking help. Contrary to popular belief, legalization of sports betting helps reduce pathological gambling by opening the door for legitimate harm reduction efforts.

Exercise 2 – Which of the following is a valid refutation? Why?
B. In arguing against reducing students’ homework load, some adults argue that tasking teenagers with more take-home assignments will keep them busy and thus out of trouble. One has to concede that students who have a lot of homework will naturally have less time and energy for trouble. However, according to the statistics reported by the Department of Justice in California (2016), the vast majority of students who committed crimes (87%) are the ones who invariably played truant and did not bother to do the assigned homework. Contrary to popular belief, more schoolwork will not reduce crimes committed by these youngsters, who are habitual school absentees.

One has to concede that students who have a lot of homework will naturally have less time and energy for trouble. However, more schoolwork can create more stress, which may undermine the emotional well-being of adolescents. According to a famous study by developmental psychologist Paul Denver (1986), teenagers who are constantly loaded with lots of schoolwork are more vulnerable to stress and anxiety compared to those with less homework. Contrary to popular belief, less homework will promote youngsters’ well-being.
Thesis statement:
Teenagers should have less homework for better development.

### Tips
The validity of a refutation, or any argument, is determined by its idea and logical progression, NOT its structure and linking words.
Coherence is best achieved by ideas, not linking words.

## Slide 27
Writing a genuine refutationA genuine refutation can be achieved by:
### Showing that the evidence supporting counter-argument is inadequate
### Showing some logical flaws inherent in the counter-argument
 In either case, you need to attack the ideas in the counter-argument.

### Unit 4 Activity 4
Example 1:
Essay topic: ‘Urbanisation is a curse.’ Do you agree or disagree?
The author’s stance: Urbanisation is NOT a curse.
However, some people are convinced that urbanization is actually a curse as it accelerates the effects of  greenhouse gasses (GHG). They believe that countless trees have been cut down in the cities for building  houses in order to accommodate a great influx of people from the suburban areas, and as a result, GHG  continue to increase to a level that exacerbates the already dire situation. Although this argument sounds valid at a glance, it does not remain tenable upon closer scrutiny. Urbanization is a blessing as it attracts  a lot of talents to work  in  the cities, which  benefits the GDP.  The talent will stay in cities where the  facilities  and  economic  development  are  much  better  than  those  in  rustic  areas.  With  the  increased  workforce, there will be a growth in GDP, and hence it could be argued that urbanization is actually a  blessing, not a curse.

## Slide 29
### Unit 4 Activity 4
### Example 2
Essay topic: Should the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) focus more on the needs of the  elderly in their urban planning?
The author’s stance: The URA SHOULD focus more on the needs of the  elderly in their  urban planning
The Urban Renewal Authority supporters may argue that research findings indicate that the health of the  elderly in redeveloped urban areas has in fact improved. As evidence, they may point to a clear correlation  between increased density and improved health in these areas (Kandt et al., 2017). This seems to indicate  that the intensity of land use in these locations gives the elderly improved access to different community  facilities, along with reduced commute time due to the proximity and variety of available services. The  impetus for this change seems echoed by elderly Kwun Tong residents who expressed a preference for  “proximity to amenities and the effective use of space” (Yung et al., 2016, p. 9). Undoubtedly, on the  surface,  such  quantitative  data  presents  a  compelling  case  that  intensity  of  land  use  correlates  with  improved health, but in reality this correlation likely merely reflects the displacement of the poor elderly  population in those gentrified locations by incoming wealthier residents. It would thus stand to reason  that displacing the poorer elderly population with a wealthier one would produce better health outcomes.  Yet, this correlation fails to take socioeconomic factors into consideration. A telling example of this is the  MTR’s transit-oriented model of development, which creates a highly dense and centralized residential  area that primarily benefits wealthier residents (Wang, 2022). This approach clearly ignores the interest  of the local socio-economically disadvantaged elderly residents.

### Unit 4 Activity 4
2. How do the authors signal this transition (from the counterargument to the refutation) in each example?
Example 1: The author somewhat acknowledges the apparent validity of the counterargument, but then concludes that it is in fact not valid before proceeding to introduce the refutation.
Example 2: The author initially makes a concession to acknowledge the apparent validity of the argument, but then uses the contrastive conjunction ‘but’ to introduce the refutation.

## Slide 36
### Unit 4 Activity 4
3. Is the counterargument and/or refutation persuasive in each example? Why or why not?
Example 1:
Both the counterargument and refutation lack research data or findings in their support to make it more convincing. They also both make assumptions and generalizations, which detracts from the overall persuasiveness. The biggest issue, however, is that the refutation is a ‘red herring’ fallacy. That is to say, it shifts the focus and does not directly address the idea in the counterargument (GHG and GDP are related but separate issues).
Example 2:
The counterargument seems convincing at a surface level but due to the writer’s use of hedging, the reader will likely be somewhat skeptical of its validity. The refutation directly addresses the counterargument and argues effectively that the counterargument is based on a superficial point of view which fails to take other relevant factors into account.

### Unit 4 – Activity 6 Writing a counter-argument and refutation paragraph
Work in pairs. Write a body paragraph (around 180 words in length) presenting the counterargument and refutation in response to the topic of “Does gentrification significantly disrupt the local ecosystems in older districts in Hong Kong?” Remember to cite evidence from the two extracts below to support your counterargument and refutation.
### Stance: Gentrification significantly disrupt the local ecosystems in older districts in Hong Kong
### Counterargument: Gentrification can occur with minimal disruptions to local ecosystems in Hong
Kong’s dilapidated older districts.
### Refutation: Gentrification in Hong Kong’s older districts significantly disrupts the lifestyles of
certain demographic groups.

## Slide 43
Extract 1 (evidence for the counterargument):
Hong Kong’s quite spectacular economic development, rising real incomes and social and cultural impacts of globalization have led to rising community aspirations for a quality living environment. Yet, much older inner-city housing stock is rundown and functionally problematic although located in vibrant and highly sought-after inner-city areas. Thus, one important consequence of Hong Kong’s urban density with regard to gentrification is that the city has not renewed its inner-city housing stock on a scale that disrupts economic and cultural development. Consequently, the inner city has remained accessible to lower-income families living in poor quality but affordable and very well-located housing; and many of these households have aged in place and have strong social networks developed, in many cases, over decades. Monkkonen and Zhang (2011) observe that while Hong Kong’s income inequalities increased between 1991 and 2006, segregation levels did not. The inner city is more diverse at a large scale although more segregated at a small scale, reflecting the construction of large-scale (often gated) housing estates targeted to different socio-economic groups. Simply put, in the inner-city areas in particular, the rich and poor live in close proximity.

## Slide 44
Extract 2 (evidence for the refutation):
### 5.3.2 Reshaping neighborhood morphology
Historically, Yuet Wah Street is a traditional settlement for Hakka and Teochew immigrants (Chao-Shan area, east of Guangdong Province, mainland China). The neighborhood has formed special kaifong associations based on Chao-Shan culture and traditions, such as Obon festival, pigeon racing and Teochew music that have been an indispensable part of their daily life. And family-operated businesses around Yuet Wah Street are largely supported by acquaintances. Hence, kaifong associations and commercial activities have come into being a neighborhood network and interaction among these inhabitants for a long time. However, through in-depth interview with the former managing board of Urban Renewal Authority, the cultural preservation strategy only targets on those traditional cultures accredited by authorities, while those minor cultures and informal traditions are likely to be demolished in the process of redevelopment.
Before redevelopment, family-operated businesses and hawkers were main commercial activities that preserve a relatively low level of living costs; and lower rental expenses dependent on old apartment buildings also supported affordable accommodation for low-income groups in Yuet Wah Street (Li, 2007). After redevelopment, relocation associated with displacement of inhabitants will break this kind of neighborhood interaction to a large extent. Figure 7 presents places of relocation or rehousing for those home owners originally living in redeveloping area. 46% of property owners (including shopkeepers) will be relocated in Kwun Tong and Kowloon east areas and other 54% will be relocated somewhere far away from their original neighborhoods.
