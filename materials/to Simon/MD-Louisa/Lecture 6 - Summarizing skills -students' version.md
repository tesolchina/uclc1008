## Slide 5
Compare the original passage with Passages A and B. Then answer the following questions.
### Original _Quote________
“But the issue was about more than Facial Recognition Technology; it exposed a critical turning point as the power, sophistication and potential exploitation of technology outpaces what users, regulators, or even its creators expected or seem prepared to handle” (Roose & Kang, 2018, para.11).
### Passage A: Summary
The quote highlights that the challenges posed by facial recognition technology reflect a broader concern: the rapid advancement and potential misuse of technology surpass the preparedness of users, regulators, and even its developers.

### An example question
E.g.
FRT has been increasingly adopted in different public spaces, including schools. Different views about the adoption of FRT in elementary schools from researchers and other stakeholders have been seen in the research literature and media.
Your task is to summarise, paraphrase and synthesise the main claims or arguments from the TWO excerpts on the adoption of FRT in schools in no more than 300 words.
Do NOT include your own views in the summary. Do NOT directly copy sentences from the excerpts – you need to write them in your own words.

### ARTICLE 1: SENG ET AL. (2021)
“Facial recognition (FR) technology is being adopted in both private and public spheres for a wide range of reasons, from ensuring physical safety to providing personalised shopping experiences. It is not clear yet, though, how users perceive this emerging technology in terms of usefulness, risks, and comfort. We begin to address these questions in this paper. In particular, we conducted a vignette-based study with 314 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to investigate their perceptions of facial recognition in the physical world, based on thirty-five scenarios across eight different contexts of FR use. We found that users do not have a binary answer towards FR adoption. Rather, their perceptions are grounded in the specific contexts in which FR will be applied. The participants considered a broad range of factors, including control over facial data, the utility of FR, the trustworthiness of organisations using FR, and the location and surroundings of FR use to place the corresponding privacy risks in context. They weighed the privacy risks with the usability, security, and economic gain of FR use as they reported their perceptions. Participants also noted the reasons and rationales behind their perceptions of facial recognition, which let us conduct an in-depth analysis of their perceived benefits, concerns, and comfort with using this technology in various scenarios. Through this first systematic look into users’ perceptions of facial recognition in the physical world, we shed light on the tension between FR adoption and users’ concerns. Taken together, our findings have broad implications that advance the Privacy and Security community’s understanding of FR through the lens of users, where we present guidelines for future research in these directions.”

## Slide 14
In groups, identify key words from the following. Using the key words, summarize the argument in one sentence.
“The use of facial recognition technology has continued to grow and expand, providing helpful and creative uses in almost all aspects of life. The expansive use of the technology in social media, in particular, has begun to facilitate conversation amongst not only lawmakers, but everyday citizens as well. Although fairly new and exciting to some, facial recognition technology has become increasingly worrisome for many, in part due to the lack of regulations surrounding the technology. As facial recognition technology evolves and expands, there is an increasing need for regulation at the federal level. These regulations should consider and incorporate language that will allow the technology to continue providing benefits to society, but also ensure that limitations and penalties are placed on users of the technology to protect citizens.” (McClellan, 2020, p.364)

## Slide 16
In groups, identify key words from the following. Using the key words, summarize the argument in one sentence.
Although the regulations and policies of private companies appear to protect users’ privacy, most companies default to an “opt-in” method, and users must proactively seek to “opt out” of their data usage. Each policy also seemingly includes language that appears to ensure users’ data is “safe,” but then speaks in overbroad terms and fails to define important words and phrases, such as “metadata.” It is also concerning that privacy policies, such as that of Shutterfly’s, now protects the privacy of California consumers differently than it protects the privacy of other consumers. The lack of consistency and clarity for users further illustrates the importance and need for federal regulations surrounding facial recognition technology.” (McClellan, 2020, p.371)
