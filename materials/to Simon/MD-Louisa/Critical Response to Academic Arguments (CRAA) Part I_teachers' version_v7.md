## Slide 14
### Structural elements of the audio clipBackground  Controversy  speaker’s stance
Since the late 2010s—especially after the pandemic—mindfulness has become a common practice in schools, clinics, and workplaces. Basically, it’s about paying attention to your body, thoughts, and feelings in the present moment, on purpose and without judgement. Many people appreciate how accessible it is with short-guided sessions delivered through apps or brief classes at work, but now people are starting to wonder about how effective it really is in large organisations. Nonetheless, during a group discussion with her classmates, Lillian argues that mindfulness significantly improves employees’ productivity. Here’s what she said:

## Slide 19
### Structural elements of the audio clipSpeaker’s Argument: PEEL structure
### [Lillian's claim]: FOR argument
One key reason mindfulness increases employees’ productivity is that it helps them remain focussed on their tasks. Findings from systematic reviews have shown that mindfulness is associated with a decrease in stress caused by distractions and overthinking. This decrease can then lead to gains in thinking ability, motivation, and attention, as well as executive functioning in the workplace. In one specific case, a company that offered brief daily mindfulness sessions found that employees reported fewer interruptions and completed routine tasks more quickly with fewer errors. This doesn’t surprise me because when workers notice their mind wandering and gently bring it back, they waste less time ruminating and switch back to the task sooner. Besides this, mindfulness practice can be done in short sessions between meetings, so employees can reset their attention without leaving their desks. With something like deadline pressure, even after a one-minute breathing exercise, a person might feel calmer and prioritise better. This suggests that the improved focus and self-regulation from mindfulness can lead to faster task completion, higher-quality output, and more efficient teamwork.

### [Narration]
Since its widespread adoption in the late 2010s, mindfulness has been increasingly promoted within corporate structures as a tool for enhancing employee performance (Background-Context). Essentially, it’s a practice of cultivating non- judgemental, present-moment awareness of one’s body, thoughts, and feelings (Background-Definition). While proponents in the business world champion these programmes for boosting well-being and focus, a growing body of critics are critical of their exploitative nature (Controversy). During a group discussion with her classmates, Grace argued that corporate mindfulness is a more subtle form of exploitation (speaker’s stance). Here’s what she said:

## Slide 22
### Tapescript
[Grace’s claim]                                                                                                                   A common criticism of corporate mindfulness programmes is that it shifts the burden of well-being onto the employee and let the companies off the hook (Point). This isn’t just a theory; it’s reflected in how programmes are sold to staff. Employers frame it as a tool for employees to individually manage their stress and enhance their job performance (Evidence-Example). This makes stress seem like a personal problem from their poor work performance instead of something caused by external factors like the work environment or materialistic society (Explanation-Elaboration). For instance, instead of hiring more staff to reduce burnout, a company may just offer a mindfulness course to employees, implying the problem is the employee's inability to cope rather than the excessive workload (Evidence-Example). So, in the end, instead of using mindfulness as a genuine tool to promote holistic well-being, large companies tend to view it as a way to create a more obedient workforce who is capable of handling a negative environment (Link/ Concluding line).
