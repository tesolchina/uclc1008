### Activity 5 – Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs (P.83-84)
### Example 1
As the time people spend online increases, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as burgeoning research areas. User data is fed directly into the design of algorithms, enabling companies to provide content customized for individual users (Bail, 2021). Some view this as a positive development, arguing that algorithms can provide users with a confidence afforded by their technological nature and mathematical precision (Sharabi, 2021). This essay, however, posits that the nature of their design is ultimately financially-driven, and thus the primary function is to manipulate users in order to increase companies’ profits. It is argued that this manipulation is essentially harmful, a harm which manifests in the reinforcement of *echo chambers, a reduction in the quality of information online, and the outsourcing of significant personal decisions to these algorithms.
* echo chamber - an environment in which a person is repeatedly and only exposed to beliefs, ideas, and opinions similar to their own
### Example 2
We love to go shopping online nowadays. Companies can use AI to convince us to buy different things. Some people think it’s good because the algorithms can make the decisions for them instead of having to decide for themselves. I think that these algorithms are bad, though. The algorithms bring many disadvantages to people online. I will discuss these in the following essay.

## Slide 15
### Activity 5 – Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs (P.83-84)
Is the background of the topic introduced in both introductions?
The background is introduced in both introductions, but the background in Example 1 is more focused with clear causal chains, whereas the causal connections in Example 2 are not as closely interrelated.

---

## Slide 16
### Activity 5 – Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs (P.83-84)
2. Is the thesis statement included in both introductions? If yes, highlight it.
Both introductions contain thesis statements but the thesis statement for Example 2 is vague (“brings many disadvantages”) and incomplete (no supporting reasons given).

## Slide 17
### Activity 5 – Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs (P.83-84)
3. Can you identify the writer’s stance (argument for/against) from the thesis statements? If so, what is it?
The stance can be identified for both, but the argument against is unclear in Example 2.

---

## Slide 18
### Activity 5 – Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs (P.83-84)
4. Can you identify the supporting reasons in the essays’ thesis statements?
The supporting reasons for Example 1 include the reinforcement of echo chambers, a reduction in the quality of information online, and the outsourcing of significant personal decisions to these algorithms. There are no supporting reasons provided for Example 2.

---

## Slide 19
### Activity 5 – Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs (P.83-84)
5. Which of the two introductions seems to be more suitable for use within an academic essay? Which features seem particularly appropriate/inappropriate?
Example 1 is superior as an academic essay as it has formal language, and all the essential components are present (background/introduction of the views on the issue/thesis statement).

## Slide 20
### Example of an Introductory Paragraph
As the time people spend online increases, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as burgeoning research areas. User data is fed directly into the design of algorithms, enabling companies to provide content customized for individual users (Bail, 2021). Some view this as a positive development, arguing that algorithms can provide users with a confidence afforded by their technological nature and mathematical precision (Sharabi, 2021).

## Slide 27
### Parallel structure in a thesis statement
Does the role of AI online pose potential detrimental effects for users?
As the time people spend online increases, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as burgeoning research areas. User data is fed directly into the design of algorithms, enabling companies to provide content customized for individual users (Bail, 2021). Some view this as a positive development, arguing that algorithms can provide users with a confidence afforded by their technological nature and mathematical precision (Sharabi, 2021). This essay, however, posits that the nature of their design is ultimately financially-driven, and thus the primary function is to manipulate users in order to increase companies’ profits. It is argued that this manipulation is essentially harmful, which manifests in the reinforcement of *echo chambers, a reduction in the quality of information online, and the outsourcing of significant personal decisions to these algorithms.
### Parallel structure when presenting the supporting reasons in the thesis statement

The same strategies can be applied to identify the writer’s stance and arguments in an argumentative essay/ research paper.

## Slide 36
### Activity 5 - Identifying Different Stances and Arguments (P. 70-74)
When different or even opposing standpoints exist, there may be multiple arguments.
 Imperative to identify who holds what viewpoints, how they relate to each other, as well as the overarching argument (central argument)

## Slide 40

## Slide 41
### Part 3 Academic Vocabulary (P.77-80)
### Understanding connotation to identify a writer’s stance
When reading a text, you can notice the patterns of positive and negative connotations.
By noting the ratio of positively connotated words to negatively connotated ones, you can gain a general understanding of the author’s stance on the issue.
### In a text, if
Positively connotated words > Negatively connotated words  the writer is likely to be supporting the issue
