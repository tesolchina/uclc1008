### Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:
Examine academic discourse, including how arguments are constructed using various models and their rhetorical purposes, pattern of development, and style;
Evaluate arguments in academic texts, as well as summarise and synthesise source materials by using appropriate academic conventions and specific citation and referencing styles (e.g. APA), and understand the rhetorical functions of citations;
Construct well-supported and logical arguments by engaging in the recursive process of reading, inventing, drafting, reviewing, reflecting, rewriting, revising, and editing;
Formulate critical spoken responses to arguments presented in audio texts, utilising various argumentation models to strengthen the responses; and
Use AI, as a learning partner, and appropriate self-access multimedia resources to foster independent learning in reading, listening, speaking and writing skills.

## Slide 9
### Key Assessments
### 4. In-class Argument Construction and Evaluation (Draft) (15%) [45 mins]
### In-class Peer Evaluation on Argument Construction and Evaluation (Draft) (5%)
Based on academic articles provided, students will write a draft of 400-500 words, utilising a specific argumentation model to construct a detailed argument, a counterargument and a rebuttal on a selected topic. The draft requires students to select ideas and supporting evidence from various sources, and then summarise, synthesise and paraphrase them to form the argument. This assignment aims to familiarise students with various argumentation frameworks (e.g. the Toulmin Model, Rogerian Argument) through asking them to apply one model to construct a well-supported argument.

---

## Slide 10
### Key Assessments
### 5. In-class Critical Response to Academic Arguments (20%) [Nov 24-28]
Students will listen to a short audio clip, which begins with background information of a topic, followed by an argument. Afterwards, students will be given time to prepare and present a verbal response in the form of a summary and a rebuttal of the argument they heard.

---

## Slide 11
### Key Assessments
### 6. Reflective Learning Portfolio (10%) [Due: 5 Dec, 6pm on Moodle] NO LATE submission
Students will engage in a reflective analysis of two to three learning episodes during the process of using AI tools throughout the course. In the 500-word portfolio, students are required to critically compare their original work with AI-generated versions and explain the rationale behind the extent of adoption or rejection in their final submission. The portfolio must include a comprehensive record of interactions with AI tools, documenting dialogues, original drafts, revisions, and final versions. The goal of this assignment is to help students use AI as a learning partner to constantly reflect on the evolution of their work and to enhance their self-directed learning skills.

---

## Slide 12
### Key Assessments
7. Argument Construction and Evaluation (Final) (20%) & Reflection on AI use in Argument Construction and Evaluation (Final) (5%)
Final Paper (20%): Students will incorporate feedback from teachers, AI tools, and peers during the process of revision and extend the draft to approximately 800 words. The rewriting process engages students in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments, counterarguments and rebuttals they read. It aims to help students construct a well-supported argument following a selected argumentation model clearly and persuasively.
Reflection on AI Use (5%): Students are required to reflect on the process of working with AI and critique AI-generated material, providing justification for the changes made in the final paper.

### Attendance Policy
### Please refer to Course Teaching Schedule and Policies on Moodle for details
Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes. If absence is due to circumstances beyond their control, to apply for make-up work (e.g. papers, assignments), a written explanation together with supporting documents must be presented to the course instructor for approval within FIVE calendar days after the absence (e.g., your written explanation and the document should be submitted to the course instructor on or before Saturday if you are absent on Monday).

---

## Slide 16
### Late submission
### Please refer to Course Teaching Schedule and Policies on Moodle for details
Late assignment submissions will incur a penalty—one percent will be deducted for each day past the deadline (weekends and statutory holidays included). For example, if your Argument Construction and Evaluation (Final) is initially awarded 17% (out of 20%) and is two days late, then the final score for this assignment will be: 17% - 2% = 15%. If you have a valid reason for late submission, you should discuss it with your lecturer prior to the assignment due date.
Students must take all assessment tests and submit all assignments. MAKE-UP tests will be allowed only upon presentation of a valid medical or official leave certificate within FIVE calendar days from the test date. (e.g., the supporting document should be submitted to the course instructor on or before Saturday if the test is scheduled for Monday).

## Slide 26
### Skimming

---

## Slide 27
### Skimming
Read Article A and answer the following questions.
1. Summarize the gist (essential meaning) of Article A in one sentence. Where can you find the gist?
### parents embrace the use of Facial Recognition Technology in elementary schools in China
### Last sentence of the Abstract

---

## Slide 28
### Skimming
2. Is Article A a conceptual (theoretical) or empirical (the real world) paper? How did you know?
Empirical. The writer actually collects responses from parents in Xuzhou with questionnaires (Abstract/ Section 4)
3. What are the main sections in this journal article?
Introduction, Literature Review, Research model and Hypotheses, Method, Data Analysis, Results, Discussion, Conclusions
### Components of an Empirical Paper
Background  identify research gap  research questions  research model/ hypotheses  research metholody  results  deeper meaning  limitations of the research and recommendations for the future

## Slide 31
### Activity 1.2
Question 1: What is the sample size of the study conducted in Article A? (i.e., how many participants were involved?)
Hint: Look for numbers and words like “participants,” “sample,” “n=” or “N=” in the “Methodology” or “Results” sections.
### 394 valid data

---

## Slide 32
### Activity 1.2
Question 2: Does the article mention the term “dangerous beliefs in the virtual world”? If so, in which section(s) does it appear?
Hint: Look for this specific phrase. You might find it in the Introduction (defining terms) or Discussion (linking findings to theory).
### Section 2.2 Dangerous Belief in the Virtual World

---

## Slide 33
### Activity 1.2
Question 3: What is the official name of the primary survey, scale, test, or instrument used to collect data?
Hint: Look for proper nouns that are often capitalised or abbreviated.
Questionnaire items: BDWV measure, the technological innovativeness measurement, the perceived value measurement and the continuance intention to use measurement
### Scale: 5-point Likert Scale
### Data collection: Questionnaire Star

---

## Slide 34
### Activity 1.2
Question 4: Find a sentence that reports a statistically significant result.
Hint: It will often contain a phrase like “was significantly higher/lower,” followed by statistical data in parentheses (e.g., p < .05).
Fig. 3 shows that the influence path coefficient of DBVW on perceived value is β = -0.320 (p<0. 001), and that of technological innovativeness is β=0.447 (p<0. 001). This means that the higher the DBVW is, the lower the perceived value is; on the contrary, the higher the technological innovativeness, the higher the perceived value. Moreover, the influence path coefficient of perceived value on intention to use was β=0.406 (p<.001), indicating that the higher the persistent value, the higher the CIU (see Fig. 3).

---

## Slide 35
### Activity 1.2
Question 5: What is one specific limitation of the study that the authors mention?
### Hint: Look for the keyword “limitation” or phrases like “we must be cautious”
This study did not examine the usage timing and the usage scope of FRT in elementary schools.
Question 6: Find one concrete suggestion the authors propose for future research.
Hint: Look for keywords like “future research should”, “recommend”, “a next step”.
Future studies may focus on how face recognition systems can be applied in classroom management and to improve teaching performance.
