## Slide 3
### Example of a three-paragraph structure
Although facial recognition technology (FRT) is becoming more common in schools worldwide, this paper argues that it is not advisable for schools to adopt FRT on campus due to possible violation of students’ privacy.
FRT intrudes on students’ privacy since the “informed consent” is not observed (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020). For instance, the facial recognition systems in operation in schools scan all students' faces in classrooms and corridors to function regardless of whether or not a student has opted out (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020). In other words, even if students can choose to opt out, the system cannot avoid scanning everyone, making "opt-in" or "opt-out" options impractical. As a result, this violates the principle of “informed consent” because students are not allowed to choose not to participate (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).
Some opponents claim that even if facial recognition systems scan all students by default, an “opt-out” mechanism still allows them to later remove their data or disable tracking, thereby preserving the principle of informed consent. However, while “opt-out” may allow data removal after scanning, the initial collection still violates privacy, as students have no rights to avoid being scanned in the first place. In fact, true consent requires the ability to refuse participation entirely, not just after the initial scanning.

### Counterargument and refutation
### Refutation
### Counterargument

## Slide 7
Why write counter-arguments and refutations?
Both counter-arguments and refutations enhance the persuasiveness of an argumentative essay by demonstrating an in-depth knowledge of viewpoints which run counter to  your own.

## Slide 9
### Comparing Two Rebuttals (Counterargument + Refutation)
### Example 1
Essay topic: ‘Urbanisation is a curse.’ Do you agree or disagree?
The author’s stance: Urbanisation is NOT a curse.
However, some people are convinced that urbanization is actually a curse as it accelerates the effects of greenhouse gasses (GHG). They believe that countless trees have been cut down in the cities for building houses in order to accommodate a great influx of people from the suburban areas, and as a result, GHG continue to increase to a level that exacerbates the already dire situation. Although this argument sounds valid at a glance, it does not remain tenable upon closer scrutiny. Urbanization is a blessing as it attracts a lot of talents to work in the cities, which benefits the GDP. The talent will stay in cities where the facilities and economic development are much better than those in rustic areas. With the increased workforce, there will be a growth in GDP, and hence it could be argued that urbanization is actually a blessing, not a curse.

## Slide 10
### Comparing Two Rebuttals (Counterargument + Refutation)
### Example 2
Essay topic: Should the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) focus more on the needs of the elderly in their urban planning?
The author’s stance: The URA SHOULD focus more on the needs of the elderly in their urban planning.
The Urban Renewal Authority supporters may argue that research findings indicate that the health of the elderly in redeveloped urban areas has in fact improved. As evidence, they may point to a clear correlation between increased density and improved health in these areas (Kandt et al., 2017). This seems to indicate that the intensity of land use in these locations gives the elderly improved access to different community facilities, along with reduced commute time due to the proximity and variety of available services. The impetus for this change seems echoed by elderly Kwun Tong residents who expressed a preference for “proximity to amenities and the effective use of space” (Yung et al., 2016, p. 9). Undoubtedly, on the surface, such quantitative data presents a compelling case that intensity of land use correlates with improved health, but in reality this correlation likely merely reflects the displacement of the poor elderly population in those gentrified locations by incoming wealthier residents. It would thus stand to reason that displacing the poorer elderly population with a wealthier one would produce better health outcomes. Yet, this correlation fails to take socioeconomic factors into consideration. A telling example of this is the MTR’s transit-oriented model of development, which creates a highly dense and centralized residential area that primarily benefits wealthier residents (Wang, 2022). This approach clearly ignores the interest of the local socio-economically disadvantaged elderly residents.

In groups of 3, identify the 4Cs in the following counter-argument and refutation paragraph with different colours.Stance:Sports gambling should be fully legalized as its benefits outweigh its harms.
Opponents of sports betting has long been lamenting that legalization of sports betting has increased pathological gambling. According to Kongsvik (1994), help-line director for the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling, the centre recorded a fair amount of sports gamblers seeking help, which rarely happened before sports betting became lawful. Admittedly, it is logical that an increased number of sports gamblers after legalization is likely to aggravate pathological gambling. Logical as it may sound, the argument _rests on the confusion between causality and correlation. According to a survey on gambling behaviour conducted by Lark (1995), the vast majority of pathological gamblers (over 90%) are more willing to seek help through official channels when they are involved in a lawful activity without any stigma, which explains the correlation between legalized sports betting and an increased number of sports gamblers seeking help. Contrary to popular belief, legalization of sports betting helps reduce pathological gambling by opening the door for legitimate harm reduction efforts.

## Slide 21
Exercise 2 – Which of the following is a valid refutation? Why?
B. In arguing against reducing students’ homework load, some adults argue that tasking teenagers with more take-home assignments will keep them busy and thus out of trouble. One has to concede that students who have a lot of homework will naturally have less time and energy for trouble. However, according to the statistics reported by the Department of Justice in California (2016), the vast majority of students who committed crimes (87%) are the ones who invariably played truant and did not bother to do the assigned homework. Contrary to popular belief, more schoolwork will not reduce crimes committed by these youngsters, who are habitual school absentees.
A. In arguing against reducing students’ homework load, some adults argue that tasking teenagers with more take-home assignments will keep them busy and thus out of trouble. One has to concede that students who have a lot of homework will naturally have less time and energy for trouble. However, more schoolwork can create more stress, which may undermine the emotional well-being of adolescents. According to a famous study by developmental psychologist Paul Denver (1986), teenagers who are constantly loaded with lots of schoolwork are more vulnerable to stress and anxiety compared to those with less homework. Contrary to popular belief, less homework will promote youngsters’ well-being.
Thesis statement:
Teenagers should have less homework for better development.

### Tips
The validity of a refutation, or any argument, is determined by its idea and logical progression, NOT its structure and linking words.
Coherence is best achieved by ideas, not linking words.

Writing an effective refutationAn effective refutation can be achieved by:
### Showing that the evidence supporting the counter-argument is inaccurate or inadequate
### Showing some logical flaws inherent in the counter-argument
 In either case, you need to attack the ideas in the counter-argument.
