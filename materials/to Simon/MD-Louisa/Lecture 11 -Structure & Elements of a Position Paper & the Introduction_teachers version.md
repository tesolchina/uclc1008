Based on excerpts from two articles on the same argumentative topic, construct an argument using the Toulmin model.
The two excerpts are of opposing views on the same argumentative topic.
E.g.
Write a three-paragraph essay on the following topic and show your position. You need to include your own views and knowledge in the essay, while citing examples or ideas from the journal articles. Construct your argument using the Toulmin Model.
“Is it advisable for schools to adopt facial recognition technologies on campus? Why or why not?

### An Example of the Position Paper Draft (First three paragraphs)
Although facial recognition technology (FRT) is becoming more common in schools worldwide, [1] this paper argues that it is not advisable for schools to adopt FRT on campus due to possible violation of students’ privacy.
[2] FRT intrudes on students’ privacy since the “informed consent” is not observed (Andrejevic & Selwyn, (2020). [3] For instance, the facial recognition systems in operation in schools scan all students' faces in classrooms and corridors to function regardless of whether or not a student has opted out (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).  In other words, even if students can choose to opt out, the system cannot avoid scanning everyone, making "opt-in" or "opt-out" options impractical. [4] As a result, this violates the principle of “informed consent” because students are not allowed to choose not to participate (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).
[5] Some opponents claim that even if facial recognition systems scan all students by default, an “opt-out” mechanism still allows them to later remove their data or disable tracking, thereby preserving the principle of informed consent. [6] However, while “opt-out” may allow data removal after scanning, the initial collection still violates privacy, as students have no rights to avoid being scanned in the first place. [7] In fact, true consent requires the ability to refuse participation entirely, not just after the initial scanning.

## Slide 12
### Activity 5 – Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs (P.83-84)
### Example 1
As the time people spend online increases, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as burgeoning research areas. User data is fed directly into the design of algorithms, enabling companies to provide content customized for individual users (Bail, 2021). Some view this as a positive development, arguing that algorithms can provide users with a confidence afforded by their technological nature and mathematical precision (Sharabi, 2021). This essay, however, posits that the nature of their design is ultimately financially-driven, and thus the primary function is to manipulate users in order to increase companies’ profits. It is argued that this manipulation is essentially harmful, a harm which manifests in the reinforcement of *echo chambers, a reduction in the quality of information online, and the outsourcing of significant personal decisions to these algorithms.
* echo chamber - an environment in which a person is repeatedly and only exposed to beliefs, ideas, and opinions similar to their own
### Example 2
We love to go shopping online nowadays. Companies can use AI to convince us to buy different things. Some people think it’s good because the algorithms can make the decisions for them instead of having to decide for themselves. I think that these algorithms are bad, though. The algorithms bring many disadvantages to people online. I will discuss these in the following essay.

### Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs
Is the background of the topic introduced in both introductions?

---

## Slide 14
### Activity 5 – Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs (P.83-84)
Is the background of the topic introduced in both introductions?
The background is introduced in both introductions, but the background in Example 1 is more focused with clear causal chains, whereas the causal connections in Example 2 are not as closely interrelated.

## Slide 16
### Activity 5 – Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs (P.83-84)
2. Is the thesis statement included in both introductions? If yes, highlight it.
Both introductions contain thesis statements but the thesis statement for Example 2 is vague (“brings many disadvantages”) and incomplete (no supporting reasons given).

## Slide 18
### Activity 5 – Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs (P.83-84)
3. Can you identify the writer’s stance (argument for/against) from the thesis statements? If so, what is it?
The stance can be identified for both, but the argument against is unclear in Example 2.

## Slide 20
### Activity 5 – Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs (P.83-84)
4. Can you identify the supporting reasons in the essays’ thesis statements?
The supporting reasons for Example 1 include the reinforcement of echo chambers, a reduction in the quality of information online, and the outsourcing of significant personal decisions to these algorithms. There are no supporting reasons provided for Example 2.

## Slide 22
### Activity 5 – Evaluating Two Introductory Paragraphs (P.83-84)
5. Which of the two introductions seems to be more suitable for use within an academic essay? Which features seem particularly appropriate/inappropriate?
Example 1 is superior as an academic essay as it has formal language, and all the essential components are present (background/introduction of the views on the issue/thesis statement).

### Example of an Introductory Paragraph

## Slide 30
### Parallel structure in a thesis statement
Does the role of AI online pose potential detrimental effects for users?
As the time people spend online increases, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as burgeoning research areas. User data is fed directly into the design of algorithms, enabling companies to provide content customized for individual users (Bail, 2021). Some view this as a positive development, arguing that algorithms can provide users with a confidence afforded by their technological nature and mathematical precision (Sharabi, 2021). This essay, however, posits that the nature of their design is ultimately financially-driven, and thus the primary function is to manipulate users in order to increase companies’ profits. It is argued that this manipulation is essentially harmful, which manifests in the reinforcement of *echo chambers, a reduction in the quality of information online, and the outsourcing of significant personal decisions to these algorithms.
### Parallel structure when presenting the supporting reasons in the thesis statement
