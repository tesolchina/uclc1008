## Slide 3
### 2nd Writing Quiz -- In-class Argument Construction (15%)
### Duration: 100 minutes
### Oct 27-31 (in-class)
Based on excerpts from two articles on the same argumentative topic, construct an argument using the Toulmin model.
The two excerpts are of opposing views on the same argumentative topic.
E.g.
Write a three-paragraph essay on the following topic and show your position. You need to include your own views and knowledge in the essay, while citing examples or ideas from the journal articles. Construct your argument using the Toulmin Model.
“Is it advisable for schools to adopt facial recognition technologies on campus? Why or why not?

---

## Slide 4
### Example of a three-paragraph structure
Although facial recognition technology (FRT) is becoming more common in schools worldwide, this paper argues that it is not advisable for schools to adopt FRT on campus due to possible violation of students’ privacy.
FRT intrudes on students’ privacy since the “informed consent” is not observed (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020). For instance, the facial recognition systems in operation in schools scan all students' faces in classrooms and corridors to function regardless of whether or not a student has opted out (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020). In other words, even if students can choose to opt out, the system cannot avoid scanning everyone, making "opt-in" or "opt-out" options impractical. As a result, this violates the principle of “informed consent” because students are not allowed to choose not to participate (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).
Some opponents claim that even if facial recognition systems scan all students by default, an “opt-out” mechanism still allows them to later remove their data or disable tracking, thereby preserving the principle of informed consent. However, while “opt-out” may allow data removal after scanning, the initial collection still violates privacy, as students have no rights to avoid being scanned in the first place. In fact, true consent requires the ability to refuse participation entirely, not just after the initial scanning.

## Slide 10
### 6 building blocks of the Toulmin Argumentation Model
### Claim
### Warrant
### Reason/ Grounds
### Backing
### Rebuttal
### Qualifier

---

## Slide 11
### Claim
### The viewpoint you are trying to convince others
### A debatable statement
E.g. Transgender women should NOT be granted access to a female bathroom.

---

## Slide 12
### Reason/ Grounds
### The “because” part of an argument
### Justification of your viewpoint
E.g. Transgender women should NOT be granted access to a female bathroom because they are not females.

---

## Slide 13
### Warrant
### Underlying assumptions and principles that justifies
### Justification of your viewpoint
### Often related to concepts like fairness, rights and justice
E.g. One’s gender should be decided by one’s physiological attributes, not just one’s own preference.

---

## Slide 14
### Backing
### Warrants are often questioned or doubted
### Backing supports and proves the warrants and assumptions you are making
E.g. Having gender identity decided by one’s physiological attributes promotes safety and stability in the society.
### Backing

---

## Slide 15
### Rebuttal
### Rebuttal
### The “even though” part of an argument
### 2 parts: Counter-argument + Response
### Counter-argument: An acknowledgment of the opposing view
Response: 3 ways to respond: concede or agree with the opposing view; refute or prove the opposing view wrong; compromise or modify claim to meet part way
E.g. Counter-argument (opposing view):
Even though transgender women with male attributes might increase the risk of sexual assault if they are allowed to use the female bathroom, not all transgender women will pose a safety threat to females in the ladies’ bathroom.
Response (compromise or modify claim):To protect the rights of both biological and transgender women, only transgender women who have undergone surgery are allowed entry to a female bathroom.

---

## Slide 16
### Qualifier
### A way of Hedging
### Words that decrease the degree of certainty by defining when and how the claim is true
### Implies the claim may not be true under all circumstances
### Help avoid sweeping statements and challenges
### Words used for hedging: probably, could, often, possibly
E.g. Transgender women who have undergone sex reassignment surgery (SRS) should be granted access to a female bathroom.
### Qualifier

---

## Slide 17
### 1st Body Paragraph
Transgender women should not be granted access to a female bathroom (Claim) because transgender women are, by definition, biologically male, which raises concerns about safety and privacy in women’s spaces. In 2016, a man masquerading as a woman was accused of assaulting women in a women’s bathroom. The man identified himself as a transgender woman. (Grounds: supporting evidence/ examples)Allowing transgender women into a female bathroom violates the principle of gender identity, which should be determined by physiological characteristics rather than personal preference. (Warrant: underlying principle logically connecting the claim and the grounds)  This perspective emphasizes the importance of maintaining the integrity of female-only environments, where the rights and safety of biological women must be prioritized. (mini-conclusion)

## Slide 18
1. What are the claim, grounds and warrant in the first body paragraph?
“In 2016, a man masquerading as a woman was accused of assaulting women in a women’s bathroom. The man identified himself as a transgender woman.”
2. What would make this evidence more credible and convincing?
One can cite from the source texts when presenting grounds: evidence/ examples to increase persuasiveness and credibility.

## Slide 19
Not all transgender women pose a safety threat to biological females in bathrooms, as many are peaceful individuals who seek basic human dignity. Studies have shown that the likelihood of sexual assault in bathrooms is low, regardless of the presence of transgender individuals. Nevertheless, to address these concerns while respecting the rights of both biological and transgender women, a reasonable response is to allow access to female bathrooms only for those transgender women who have undergone gender-affirming surgeries. This policy provides a balanced approach, ensuring that safety concerns are taken seriously while still affirming the identity of transgender women who have made significant commitments to their transition.
