we need to revise this html as a sample lesson

each lesson should have some clear objectives focusing on change of behaviors as academic writers

we should develop an html file that include a complete learning module or lesson

following the objectives
there should be a bit more notes on the concepts/techniques and demos from the course materials- then followed by some MC questions, practice, etc

the materials should be suitable for both classroom teaching and independent study

based on the instructions above; create a new sample html file also focusing on paraphrasing

==============above is done==========

latest comments: 

the new sample is better 

we want more notes and examples to be added to each non-MC practice tasks 

this way students can learn more things right before working on a task 

as for MC practice tasks- there should be more detailed explanations and demo after students attempt the tasks 

we could reduce the number of practice tasks slightly
