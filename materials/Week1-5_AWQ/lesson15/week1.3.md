# Week 1, Lesson 3: Abstract Analysis Lab

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Deconstruct an abstract into its functional "moves" (Context, Gap, Purpose, Method, Results, Conclusion).
2. Predict the article's content and stance based *only* on the abstract.
3. Identify "Signpost Words" that signal transitions between moves.

## Materials Needed
- **Sample Abstracts:** From Article A and Article B.
- **Reference:** `Study Guide to Academic Writing Quiz.md` (Part 1, Step 2).

## Content Breakdown

### 1. Concept: Signpost Words in Abstracts
*   **Context:** "A great deal of attention...", "Traditionally...", "Is increasingly adopted..."
*   **Gap:** "However...", "Nonetheless...", "Little attention has been paid...", "Critical questions remain..."
*   **Purpose:** "This study examined...", "This article contends...", "We aim to..."
*   **Results/Argument:** "Results indicate...", "We argue that...", "This suggests..."
*   **Conclusion:** "Therefore...", "In conclusion...", "This implies..."

### 2. Activity: Labelling Article A Abstract
*   *Text:* "A great deal of attention has been focused on technological innovation..." -> **Context**
*   *Text:* "Nonetheless, there has been little attention paid to parents’ acceptance..." -> **Gap**
*   *Text:* "To address this gap... this study examined..." -> **Purpose**
*   *Text:* "Results indicating that..." -> **Results**
*   *Text:* "The results suggest that parents support..." -> **Conclusion/Stance**

### 3. Activity: Labelling Article B Abstract
*   *Text:* "Facial recognition technology is now being introduced..." -> **Context**
*   *Text:* "While critical commentators are beginning to question..." -> **Gap/Transition**
*   *Text:* "This article contends that..." -> **Purpose/Argument**
*   *Text:* "This includes the likelihood of... altering the nature of schools..." -> **Argument Detail**
*   *Text:* "Considers whether or not a valid case can ever be made..." -> **Stance (Doubt)**

## Interactive Elements for HTML
1.  **Colour Coding:** Students select text and assign a colour (e.g., Blue for Context, Red for Gap, Green for Purpose).
2.  **Prediction Check:** "Based on this abstract, will the article use statistics?" (Yes for A, No for B).
3.  **Fill in the Blank:** Complete a summary of the abstract using the key moves.

## Key Takeaway
"The abstract is a mini-version of the whole paper. If you can map the abstract, you have a cheat sheet for the entire article."
