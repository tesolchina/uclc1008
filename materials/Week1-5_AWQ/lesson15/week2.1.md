# Week 2, Lesson 1: APA 7th Citation Bootcamp

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1.  Identify the difference between **Author-Prominent** and **Information-Prominent** citations.
2.  Apply **APA 7th** formatting rules for in-text citations (one author, two authors, three+ authors).
3.  Recognize and correct common citation errors in student writing.
4.  Understand the concept of **Secondary Citations** (citing a source cited in another source).

## Content Breakdown

### 1. Concept: Two Ways to Cite
*   **Information-Prominent (Parenthetical):** The focus is on the *information*. The author is secondary.
    *   *Example:* "Parents generally recognize the value of face recognition systems (Kim et al., 2007)."
    *   *Use when:* You want to emphasize the fact or finding.
*   **Author-Prominent (Narrative):** The focus is on the *author's* argument or finding.
    *   *Example:* "Kim et al. (2007) argue that parents generally recognize the value of face recognition systems."
    *   *Use when:* You are comparing authors' views or tracing an argument (e.g., "Author A argues X, but Author B disagrees").

### 2. Mechanics: APA 7th Basics (In-Text)
*   **One Author:** (Smith, 2020) or Smith (2020)
*   **Two Authors:** (Wang & Lee, 2020) or Wang and Lee (2020)
    *   *Note:* Use "&" inside parentheses, "and" outside.
*   **Three or More Authors:** (Kaiser et al., 2021) or Kaiser et al. (2021)
    *   *Note:* "et al." stands for "and others". Note the period after "al".

### 3. Concept: Secondary Citations
*   **Definition:** When you read Article A, and Article A cites "Perry & Sibley (2010)", but you haven't read Perry & Sibley yourself.
*   **Rule:** Cite the work you read (Article A) in the reference list. In the text, name the original work and give the citation for the secondary source.
*   **Example:** "Perry and Sibley (2010, as cited in Wang, 2021) note that..."
*   *AWQ Context:* The AWQ articles often summarize other research. You must decide if you are citing the *Article author* or the *study they are quoting*. Usually, for the summary, you focus on what the *Article author* is using that evidence to prove.

## Interactive HTML Elements (Draft Ideas)

### Activity 1: The "And" vs. "&" Toggle
*   **Type:** Multiple Choice / Toggle
*   **Task:** Choose the correct format.
    1.  According to Wang [ and / & ] Lee (2020)...
    2.  This finding was contradicted by later studies (Wang [ and / & ] Lee, 2020).

### Activity 2: Citation Fixer
*   **Type:** Text correction
*   **Task:** Identify the error in these sentences.
    *   *Error:* "According to (Smith, 2020), facial recognition is dangerous." -> *Fix:* "According to Smith (2020)..."
    *   *Error:* "Research shows X is true (Smith, 2020, p. 15)." (for a summary/paraphrase) -> *Fix:* Remove page number (usually only for direct quotes).
    *   *Error:* "Kaiser, Smith and Jones (2021) found that..." -> *Fix:* "Kaiser et al. (2021) found that..."

### Activity 3: Author vs. Info Drag-and-Drop
*   **Type:** Drag and Drop
*   **Task:** Sort these sentences into "Author-Prominent" or "Information-Prominent".
    *   "Research indicates that FRT is invasive (Smith, 2019)." (Info)
    *   "Smith (2019) warns that FRT is invasive." (Author)

## Key Takeaway
"Citations are not just rules; they are signposts. They tell the reader whose voice is speaking. In the AWQ, using Author-Prominent citations (e.g., 'Author A argues...') is often the best way to synthesize distinct viewpoints."
