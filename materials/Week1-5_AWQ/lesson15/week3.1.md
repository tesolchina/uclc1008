# Week 3, Lesson 1: The Art of Summarising

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1.  Distinguish between **Main Ideas** (Claims) and **Supporting Details** (Evidence/Examples).
2.  Apply the principle of **Neutrality** (avoiding personal opinion).
3.  Practice **Conciseness** (deleting redundancy).

## Content Breakdown

### 1. Concept: What to Keep, What to Cut
*   **Keep (The "Meat"):**
    *   The Main Argument / Stance.
    *   Key Claims (Reasons for the stance).
    *   Topic Sentences.
*   **Cut (The "Fat"):**
    *   Specific Data/Statistics (e.g., "3.865 average score").
    *   Methodological details (e.g., "snowball sampling", "structural equation modelling").
    *   Specific Examples (unless critical for context).
    *   Repetitive phrases.
*   *AWQ Rule:* "Omit detailed/specific Evidence/Data because examples/data do not speak for the Stance." (Study Guide).

### 2. Concept: Neutrality
*   **Rule:** A summary reports *what the author said*, not what *you think*.
*   **Avoid:** "I think...", "Interestingly...", "Unfortunately...".
*   **Use:** "The author states...", "The study found...", "It is argued that...".

### 3. Strategy: The "Delete" Method
*   **Step 1:** Read the paragraph.
*   **Step 2:** Cross out specific dates, numbers, and names of places.
*   **Step 3:** Cross out adjectives that are just for flavor.
*   **Step 4:** Read what is left. Does it still make sense? That's your summary core.

## Interactive HTML Elements (Draft Ideas)

### Activity 1: The "Slasher" (Text Editor)
*   **Type:** Text Highlighting / Deletion
*   **Task:** You are given a paragraph from Article A. Click on the words/sentences you should **REMOVE** for a summary.
    *   *Text:* "This study adopted snowball sampling to collect data through questionnaires, and received 380 valid responses from parents living in Xuzhou, China."
    *   *Correct Action:* Delete almost all of it.
    *   *Keep:* Nothing from this sentence is needed for the main argument summary, except maybe "The study surveyed parents."

### Activity 2: Claim vs. Evidence Sorter
*   **Type:** Drag and Drop
*   **Task:** Sort statements into "Keep (Claim)" or "Discard (Detail)".
    *   "DBVW was negatively related to perceived value." (Keep - Main Finding)
    *   "The average score was 3.865." (Discard - Data)
    *   "Schools enforce dress codes like banning hoods." (Discard - Specific Example)
    *   "Facial recognition is inescapable in schools." (Keep - Main Argument)

### Activity 3: Neutrality Check
*   **Type:** Multiple Choice
*   **Task:** Identify the neutral summary sentence.
    *   A: "The author brilliantly argues that FRT is safe." (Biased - "brilliantly")
    *   B: "The author argues that FRT is safe." (Neutral)
    *   C: "The author wrongly suggests that FRT is safe." (Biased - "wrongly")

## Key Takeaway
"A summary is a reduction, not a reflection. If you find yourself writing numbers or specific examples, stop. You are likely too deep in the details."
