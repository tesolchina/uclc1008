# Week 1, Lesson 2: Reading with Purpose

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Use **Section Headings** to navigate the structure of an argument.
2. Locate and analyse **Topic Sentences** to identify main ideas.
3. Distinguish between **Author's Claims** and **Opposing Claims**.

## Materials Needed
- **Sample Articles:** Article A and Article B from AWQ Sample.
- **Reference:** `Study Guide to Academic Writing Quiz.md` (Part 1, Step 3 & 4).

## Content Breakdown

### 1. Concept: The Power of Headings
Headings are the roadmap. They often reveal the "Context" + "Stance".
*   *Example:* "Challenging the take-up of facial recognition in schools"
    *   *Context:* Facial recognition in schools.
    *   *Stance:* Challenging (Negative/Critical).

### 2. Concept: Topic Sentences (TS)
The TS is usually the first or second sentence of a paragraph. It summarises the paragraph's main idea.
*   *Formula:* **Topic** + **Controlling Idea**.
*   *Example:* "Another point of concern is the inescapability of facial monitoring within school contexts."
    *   *Topic:* Facial monitoring.
    *   *Controlling Idea:* It is inescapable (a concern).

### 3. Skill: Separating Claims from Evidence
*   **Claim:** The main argument (e.g., "Parents generally support FRT.").
*   **Evidence:** The data/examples used to support it (e.g., "The average score was 3.919.").
*   *AWQ Tip:* You need to summarise the **Claims**, not the specific **Data/Evidence**.

### 4. Activity: Finding the "So What?"
*   Identifying Concluding Sentences that link back to the main argument.
*   *Example:* "Therefore, this study suggests that the higher the parents’ DBVW, the lower the value they perceived."

## Interactive Elements for HTML
1.  **Highlighting Task:** Find the Topic Sentence in a provided paragraph.
2.  **Matching:** Match a Section Heading to the correct paragraph content.
3.  **Filter:** Given a paragraph, cross out the "Evidence" sentences and keep the "Claim" sentences.

## Key Takeaway
"Read the **Headings** and **Topic Sentences** first. If you understand those, you understand 80% of the article's argument without getting lost in the details."
