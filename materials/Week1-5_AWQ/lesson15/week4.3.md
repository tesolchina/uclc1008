# Week 4, Lesson 3: Self-Correction Lab

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1.  Critically analyze their own writing from Lesson 4.2.
2.  Use a **Correction Code** or Checklist to identify common errors.
3.  Differentiate between "Global Errors" (Meaning) and "Local Errors" (Grammar).

## Content Breakdown

### 1. Concept: The Editor's Mindset
*   **Shift Gears:** You are no longer the writer. You are the grader.
*   **The Checklist:**
    1.  **Relevance:** Did I answer the prompt? (Did I mention "Inescapability"?).
    2.  **Accuracy:** Did I misrepresent the author? (Did I say they "hate" it when they only "questioned" it?).
    3.  **Citations:** Are they in APA format?
    4.  **Paraphrasing:** Is it too close to the original?

### 2. Common Student Errors (Analysis)
*   *The "List" Error:* "Article A said this. Then Article A said this." (Fix: Group by theme).
*   *The "Opinion" Error:* "I agree with Article B." (Fix: Delete "I agree").
*   *The "Quote" Error:* Quoting too much. (Fix: Paraphrase).

## Interactive HTML Elements (Draft Ideas)

### Activity 1: The Red Pen
*   **Type:** Highlight Errors
*   **Task:** Highlight the errors in this sample "Student Answer".
    *   *Text:* "I think Article A is right (Smith 2020). The technology is scary."
    *   *Errors:* "I think" (Opinion), "(Smith 2020)" (Missing comma), "scary" (Informal language).

### Activity 2: Self-Reflection Log
*   **Type:** Survey / Form
*   **Task:** Rate your performance in Lesson 4.2.
    *   How was your timing? [Too slow / Just right / Rushed]
    *   What was the hardest part? [Reading / Citations / Writing]
    *   One goal for next week: __________________.

### Activity 3: Compare with Model
*   **Type:** Accordion / Reveal
*   **Task:** Show your answer next to a "Model Answer".
    *   *Reflection:* "What did the model do that I didn't?"

## Key Takeaway
"You are your own best teacher. The ability to spot your own mistakes *before* the teacher sees them is the ultimate skill."
