# Week 2, Lesson 2: Paraphrasing Strategies (Core)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1.  Apply three core paraphrasing techniques: **Synonym Replacement**, **Changing Word Forms**, and **Changing Sentence Structure**.
2.  Avoid "patchwriting" (replacing only a few words).
3.  Maintain the original meaning and "Voice" (neutrality) of the source.

## Content Breakdown

### 1. Technique: Synonym Replacement
*   **Concept:** Replacing words with similar meanings without changing the context.
*   **Warning:** Danger of "Thesaurus abuse". Only use synonyms you know fit the context.
*   *Example:*
    *   *Original:* "Facial recognition technology is now being **introduced** across various aspects of **public life**."
    *   *Bad Synonym:* "Facial recognition technology is now being **acquainted** across various aspects of **civic existence**." (Unnatural)
    *   *Good Synonym:* "Facial recognition systems are increasingly being **implemented** in **public spaces**."

### 2. Technique: Changing Word Forms
*   **Concept:** Changing a verb to a noun, an adjective to an adverb, etc. This forces you to change the sentence structure.
*   **Example:**
    *   *Original:* "The author **supports** the use of FR systems." (Verb)
    *   *Paraphrase:* "The author expresses **support** for the implementation of FR systems." (Noun)
    *   *Original:* "Parents **anxiously** viewed the technology." (Adverb)
    *   *Paraphrase:* "Parents expressed **anxiety** regarding the technology." (Noun)

### 3. Technique: Changing Sentence Structure (Active/Passive)
*   **Concept:** Flipping the subject and object or combining sentences.
*   **Example:**
    *   *Original:* "Schools use these technologies for security." (Active)
    *   *Paraphrase:* "These technologies are utilized by schools for security purposes." (Passive)

## Interactive HTML Elements (Draft Ideas)

### Activity 1: Synonym Slider
*   **Type:** Multiple Choice (Word Selection)
*   **Task:** Select the best synonym for the bolded word in the academic context.
    *   "The study **examined**..." -> [looked at / investigated / stared at]
    *   "Critical questions **remain**..." -> [stay / persist / are left]
    *   "This article **contends**..." -> [fights / argues / says]

### Activity 2: The Paraphrase Builder
*   **Type:** Drag and Drop / Reorder
*   **Task:** Reassemble a paraphrased sentence from scrambled chunks.
    *   *Original:* "DBVW was negatively related to perceived value."
    *   *Chunks:* [a negative correlation] [between] [DBVW and perceived value] [The results showed]
    *   *Target:* "The results showed a negative correlation between DBVW and perceived value."

### Activity 3: "Too Close?" Checker
*   **Type:** Binary Choice
*   **Task:** Compare Original vs. Paraphrase. Is it "Good Paraphrase" or "Plagiarism/Patchwriting"?
    *   *Original:* "Facial recognition technology is now being introduced across various aspects of public life."
    *   *Candidate:* "Facial recognition tech is now being introduced in many parts of public life." -> **Verdict:** Patchwriting (Too close structure/words).
    *   *Candidate:* "The deployment of facial recognition systems is becoming common in public sectors." -> **Verdict:** Good.

## Key Takeaway
"Good paraphrasing changes the *words* and the *structure* but keeps the *meaning* exactly the same. Never add your own opinion when paraphrasing in a summary."
