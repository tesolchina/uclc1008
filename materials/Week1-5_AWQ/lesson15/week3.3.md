# Week 3, Lesson 3: AWQ Structure Prep

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1.  Structure the AWQ response into **3 Standard Paragraphs** (Intro, Body, Conclusion).
2.  Draft a strong **Thesis Statement** that previews the essay.
3.  Write a **Topic Sentence** that synthesizes the main idea of the body paragraph.

## Content Breakdown

### 1. The 3-Part Structure (Standard AWQ Model)
*   **Paragraph 1: Introduction (approx. 50-75 words)**
    *   *Background:* Contextualize the topic (e.g., "FRT is expanding in schools").
    *   *Thesis Statement:* Preview the main contrast/arguments (e.g., "This paper examines the tension between parental support for FRT and the ethical concerns regarding student privacy.").
*   **Paragraph 2: Body (approx. 150-200 words)**
    *   *Topic Sentence:* Introduce the main themes (e.g., "While proponents highlight efficiency, critics question the morality of surveillance.").
    *   *Synthesis:* Weave Article A and B together using the themes (Security, Privacy, Consent).
    *   *No specific data:* Focus on claims.
*   **Paragraph 3: Conclusion (approx. 25-50 words)**
    *   *Recap:* Summarize the main takeaway.
    *   *Final Thought:* A neutral closing statement on the state of the debate.

### 2. The Thesis Statement
*   **Formula:** [Topic] + [Article A Stance] + [Connector] + [Article B Stance].
*   *Example:* "This summary contrasts the findings of parental support for FRT (Article A) with the critical concerns regarding its authoritarian nature (Article B)."

### 3. The Body Paragraph Structure
*   **Topic Sentence** -> **Point 1 (Article A)** -> **Contrast/Comparison** -> **Point 2 (Article B)** -> **Point 3 (Synthesis/Implication)**.

## Interactive HTML Elements (Draft Ideas)

### Activity 1: Skeleton Builder
*   **Type:** Drag and Drop
*   **Task:** Drag the components into the right order for the Introduction.
    *   [Context/Background] -> [Thesis Statement]

### Activity 2: Thesis Evaluator
*   **Type:** Multiple Choice
*   **Task:** Rate these Thesis Statements.
    *   "In this essay I will write about FRT." (Too vague)
    *   "Article A is about parents and Article B is about schools." (Too simple)
    *   "This summary examines the divergence between parental acceptance of FRT and the ethical implications of its inescapable nature." (Strong)

### Activity 3: Paragraph Puzzler
*   **Type:** Reorder Paragraph
*   **Task:** Put the Body Paragraph sentences in order.
    1.  [Topic Sentence: The debate centers on the trade-off between perceived value and individual rights.]
    2.  [Article A demonstrates that parents value the security FRT provides.]
    3.  [However, Article B challenges this, arguing that security should not come at the cost of privacy.]
    4.  [Consequently, the validity of 'consent' in such systems is questioned.]

## Key Takeaway
"Structure saves you time. If you know exactly what goes in the Introduction, you don't have to 'think' about it during the exam. You just fill in the slots."
