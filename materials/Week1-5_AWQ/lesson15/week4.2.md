# Week 4, Lesson 2: Timed Practice Session (Simulation)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1.  Complete a **Mini-AWQ Task** (Summary of 2 paragraphs) under strict time conditions (20 mins).
2.  Manage time effectively between Reading, Planning, and Writing.

## Content Breakdown

### 1. The Simulation Setup
*   **Context:** You will simulate a shortened version of the exam.
*   **Materials:** Two short excerpts (approx. 150 words each) derived from the AWQ Sample materials (or similar themes).
*   **Task:** Write a 100-word paragraph synthesizing the two views.

### 2. Time Management Strategy (The 20-Minute Block)
*   **0:00 - 3:00:** Read & Annotate (Identify Stance, Claims).
*   **3:00 - 5:00:** Plan (Topic Sentence, Connection).
*   **5:00 - 15:00:** Write (Drafting).
*   **15:00 - 20:00:** Review (Check citations, Reporting verbs).

### 3. The Task Prompt
*   *Prompt:* "Summarise the differing views on the 'Inescapability' of FRT in schools based on the provided excerpts."

## Interactive HTML Elements (Draft Ideas)

### Activity 1: The Exam Timer
*   **Type:** Countdown Timer + Text Area
*   **Task:** The screen shows the two texts and a text box.
    *   *Timer:* Starts at 20:00.
    *   *Warnings:* At 10:00 ("Halfway"), 5:00 ("Start Reviewing"), 1:00 ("Wrap up").

### Activity 2: "Did You Plan?" Check
*   **Type:** Checklist (Before Writing)
*   **Task:** Before the text box unlocks, check these boxes:
    *   [ ] I have identified Article A's stance.
    *   [ ] I have identified Article B's stance.
    *   [ ] I have a reporting verb ready for each.

## Key Takeaway
"The clock is your friend if you stick to the schedule. Panic happens when you spend 10 minutes reading and only have 5 minutes to write. Trust the 'Scan & Plan'."
