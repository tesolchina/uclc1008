# Week 4, Lesson 1: Speed Drills (Review)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1.  Identify **Citation Errors** in under 10 seconds.
2.  Locate the **Stance** of an article in under 2 minutes (scanning title/abstract).
3.  Draft a **Thesis Statement** in under 3 minutes.

## Content Breakdown

### 1. Concept: The "Scan & Plan" Speed
*   **The Goal:** You have limited time in the AWQ. You cannot read every word slowly.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Minute 0-2: Read Titles and Abstracts. Determine Stance (Support/Doubt).
    *   Minute 2-5: Skim headings and topic sentences.
    *   Minute 5-10: Draft Thesis and Outline.

### 2. Speed Drill: Citation Spotting
*   **Common Errors to spot fast:**
    *   Missing year.
    *   "&" outside parentheses.
    *   First name initials included (e.g., "J. Smith").
    *   No p. number for quotes (if applicable, though AWQ usually summarizes).

### 3. Speed Drill: Paraphrasing Sprints
*   **Task:** Read a sentence. Rewrite it in 1 minute.
*   **Focus:** Good enough is better than perfect. Don't get stuck on one word.

## Interactive HTML Elements (Draft Ideas)

### Activity 1: The 10-Second Citation Challenge
*   **Type:** Timed Quiz (Rapid Fire)
*   **Task:** Flash a citation. User hits "Correct" or "Incorrect".
    *   "(Smith, 2020)" -> Correct
    *   "(Smith, 2020, p.10)" -> Correct
    *   "Smith (2020) argue..." -> Incorrect (argues)
    *   "(Smith and Jones, 2020)" -> Incorrect (&)

### Activity 2: Stance Speed Run
*   **Type:** Timed Choice
*   **Task:** Read a Title. Click "Support" or "Doubt".
    *   *Title:* "The benefits of FRT." -> Support
    *   *Title:* "FRT: A threat to privacy?" -> Doubt
    *   *Title:* "Critical questions regarding FRT." -> Doubt

### Activity 3: Thesis Sprint (Text Input)
*   **Type:** Text Input with Timer
*   **Task:** You have 3 minutes to write a thesis statement combining these two prompts:
    *   *Article A:* Supports FRT for efficiency.
    *   *Article B:* Opposes FRT for bias.
    *   *Timer counts down.*

## Key Takeaway
"Speed comes from confidence. If you know the structure (Week 3) and the mechanics (Week 2), you don't have to hesitate."
