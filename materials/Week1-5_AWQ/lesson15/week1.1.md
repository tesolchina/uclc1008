# Week 1, Lesson 1: Anatomy of an Article

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Distinguish between **Empirical** and **Conceptual** research articles.
2. Analyse article **Titles** to identify subject matter, context, and author stance.
3. Identify the standard components of an **Abstract**.

## Materials Needed
- **Sample Articles:** Excerpts from "Supporting schools to use face recognition systems" (Article A) and "Facial recognition technology in schools: critical questions and concerns" (Article B) from the AWQ Sample.
- **Reference:** `Study Guide to Academic Writing Quiz.md` (Part 1, Step 1 & 2).

## Content Breakdown

### 1. Concept: Empirical vs. Conceptual Articles
*   **Empirical:** Based on observed and measured phenomena. Derives knowledge from actual experience rather than from theory or belief.
    *   *Key Sections:* Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion/Conclusion.
    *   *Clues in Abstract:* "This study examined...", "Data was collected...", "Results indicated...".
*   **Conceptual (Theoretical):** Focuses on abstract ideas or theories. No original data collection (e.g., surveys/experiments).
    *   *Key Sections:* Introduction, Literature Review, Theoretical Framework, Discussion/Conclusion.
    *   *Clues in Abstract:* "This article contends...", "This paper argues...", "We propose...".

### 2. Activity: Title Analysis (Predicting Stance)
*   **Strategy:** Look for keywords that indicate attitude.
    *   *Positive:* Supporting, Enhancing, Benefits, Effectiveness.
    *   *Negative/Critical:* Concerns, Challenges, Limitations, Risks, Doubt, Questions.
    *   *Neutral:* Analysis, Study, Investigation, Perspectives.

*   **Example A:** "Supporting schools to use face recognition systems..."
    *   *Stance:* **Support/Endorse**.
*   **Example B:** "Facial recognition technology in schools: critical questions and concerns"
    *   *Stance:* **Doubt/Challenge**.

### 3. Concept: Abstract Structure (The "Moves")
An abstract usually follows a predictable pattern:
1.  **Context/Background:** What is the general topic?
2.  **Gap/Problem:** What is missing or wrong? ("However...", "Little attention...")
3.  **Purpose:** What does this paper do? ("This study examines...")
4.  **Method (Empirical only):** How was it done? ("Surveys...", "Interviews...")
5.  **Results/Arguments:** What did they find?
6.  **Conclusion/Implications:** So what?

## Interactive Elements for HTML
1.  **MCQ:** Identify if a title suggests a "Support", "Refute", or "Neutral" stance.
2.  **Drag & Drop:** Label parts of an abstract (Context, Gap, Purpose, etc.).
3.  **Split Screen:** Show Article A abstract and ask students to highlight the "Purpose Statement".

## Key Takeaway
"Don't read word-for-word yet. Scan the **Title** and **Abstract** first to build a mental map of what the article is about and what side the author is on."
