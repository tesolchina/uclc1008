# Week 2, Lesson 3: Integrated Writing Practice

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1.  Combine **Citations** and **Paraphrasing** into smooth sentences.
2.  Use **Reporting Verbs** (e.g., *claims, suggests, highlights*) to signal the author's stance.
3.  Differentiate between reporting an author's *finding* vs. their *opinion*.

## Content Breakdown

### 1. Concept: Reporting Verbs & Stance
*   **Neutral Verbs:** Used for stating facts or describing the study.
    *   *Examples:* states, describes, notes, observes, examines.
    *   *Usage:* "Article A **examines** the relationship between..."
*   **Argumentative Verbs:** Used when the author is making a claim or expressing an opinion.
    *   *Examples:* argues, contends, claims, maintains, asserts.
    *   *Usage:* "The author **contends** that social challenges outweigh the benefits."
*   **Suggestion/Implication Verbs:** Used for conclusions.
    *   *Examples:* suggests, implies, recommends, proposes.
    *   *Usage:* "The results **suggest** that parents support FRT."

### 2. Concept: The "Citation Sandwich"
*   **Top Slice:** Introduce the source (Signal Phrase).
*   **Meat:** The paraphrased information.
*   **Bottom Slice:** Parenthetical citation (if not fully covered in the signal phrase) or transition to next point.
*   *Example:* "According to Article A (Top), parental support for FRT is largely driven by its perceived value for security (Meat), despite privacy concerns (Bottom)."

### 3. Practice: Synthesizing Small Chunks
*   **Task:** Take a claim from Article A and a claim from Article B. Combine them.
    *   *Article A Claim:* Parents support FRT.
    *   *Article B Claim:* FRT causes social division.
    *   *Synthesis:* "While Article A highlights parental support for FRT, Article B warns of its potential to create social division."

## Interactive HTML Elements (Draft Ideas)

### Activity 1: Reporting Verb Selector
*   **Type:** Dropdown
*   **Task:** Choose the best verb for the context.
    1.  The study [ argues / examines ] the effects of FRT. (Fact -> Examines)
    2.  The author [ states / contends ] that FRT is dangerous. (Opinion -> Contends)
    3.  The data [ claims / suggests ] a positive correlation. (Data Interpretation -> Suggests)

### Activity 2: Sentence Combiner
*   **Type:** Text Input / Multiple Choice
*   **Task:** Combine two sentences into one using a transition word (However, While, Furthermore).
    *   *Sentence 1:* "Article A focuses on parental acceptance."
    *   *Sentence 2:* "Article B focuses on ethical concerns."
    *   *Target:* "Article A focuses on parental acceptance, **whereas** Article B highlights ethical concerns."

### Activity 3: The "Voice" Check
*   **Type:** Highlight Text
*   **Task:** Highlight the parts of the sentence that show the *student's* voice vs. the *source's* voice.
    *   "Although [Wang (2020) argues] that FRT is useful, [Smith (2021) counters] that it is invasive."
    *   *Goal:* Students see how their choice of reporting verbs controls the narrative.

## Key Takeaway
"Your summary is a conversation between you and the sources. Use reporting verbs to control that conversation. Don't just list facts; tell the reader *what the author is doing* (arguing, suggesting, examining)."
