# Week 5, Lesson 2: Feedback Session

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1.  Analyze a **Model Answer** to understand what constitutes an "A" grade.
2.  Identify specific areas for improvement in their own Mock Exam.
3.  Revise a weak paragraph into a strong one.

## Content Breakdown

### 1. Analysis of the Model Answer
*   **Structure:** Look at the Intro. Does it have a thesis? Yes.
*   **Synthesis:** Look at the Body. Does it use connectors like "In contrast"? Yes.
*   **Mechanics:** Look at the Citations. Are they accurate? Yes.

### 2. Common Pitfalls (Feedback Round-up)
*   *Pitfall 1:* "He said / She said" (Repetitive reporting verbs). -> *Fix:* Use "argues", "notes", "emphasizes".
*   *Pitfall 2:* Getting lost in the data (Writing about 3.865 score). -> *Fix:* Focus on "positive correlation".
*   *Pitfall 3:* Copying the Abstract. -> *Fix:* Paraphrase the *main idea*, don't just copy the abstract's summary.

## Interactive HTML Elements (Draft Ideas)

### Activity 1: Grade the Sample
*   **Type:** Multiple Choice / Rating
*   **Task:** Read two paragraphs. Which one is better? Why?
    *   *Sample A:* Good synthesis, accurate citations.
    *   *Sample B:* Choppy, list-like, spelling errors.
    *   *Question:* "Which sample demonstrates better synthesis?"

### Activity 2: The Revision Challenge
*   **Type:** Text Edit
*   **Task:** Improve this weak sentence.
    *   *Weak:* "Article A says it is good. Article B says it is bad."
    *   *Your Edit:* _________________________.
    *   *Model Edit:* "While Article A highlights the benefits, Article B emphasizes the drawbacks."

### Activity 3: Error Hunt (Advanced)
*   **Type:** Highlight
*   **Task:** Find the *subtle* error in this "A-" paragraph.
    *   (Maybe a slight misinterpretation of stance or a minor citation formatting issue).

## Key Takeaway
"Feedback is the breakfast of champions. Don't hide from your mistakes; study them so you don't repeat them."
