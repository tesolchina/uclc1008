# Week 3, Lesson 2: Synthesis & Outlining

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1.  Define **Synthesis** (combining sources) vs. **Summarising** (listing sources).
2.  Group arguments from different texts under **Thematic Headings**.
3.  Use **Connectives** to show relationships (Agreement, Contrast, Extension).

## Content Breakdown

### 1. Concept: Synthesis vs. List
*   **The List (Bad):** "Article A says X. Article A says Y. Article B says Z. Article B says Q."
*   **The Synthesis (Good):** "Both Article A and B discuss X, but they disagree on Y."
*   **Metaphor:** Don't just stack the bricks (facts) side-by-side. Weave them together into a wall.

### 2. Strategy: Finding Common Themes
*   Look at Article A and Article B. Do they talk about the same things?
    *   *Theme 1: Security/Safety.* (Article A: Good for security. Article B: Security is an excuse for surveillance.)
    *   *Theme 2: Parental/Student Views.* (Article A: Parents support it. Article B: Students can't opt-out.)
    *   *Theme 3: Future Implications.* (Article A: Adopt it more. Article B: It's dangerous/oppressive.)

### 3. Strategy: The "Synthesis Grid"
*   Create a grid with Themes on the left and Articles on the top. Fill in the boxes. This makes writing the body paragraph easy.

| Theme | Article A (Support) | Article B (Doubt) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Privacy** | Parents trust the system (Low anxiety). | System is invasive/inescapable. |
| **Adoption** | Should be expanded to other schools. | Should be challenged/stopped. |

### Activity 1: Thematic Matching
*   **Type:** Drag and Drop
*   **Task:** Match the argument to the Theme.
    *   *Theme: Privacy* -> [Article B: "Constant surveillance"]
    *   *Theme: Efficiency* -> [Article A: "Automated registration"]
    *   *Theme: Consent* -> [Article B: "No opt-out option"]

### Activity 2: Connector Logic
*   **Type:** Fill in the Blank
*   **Task:** Choose the right connector.
    *   "Article A claims parents support FRT; **[conversely / similarly]**, Article B argues it is oppressive." (Contrast)
    *   "Article A highlights the benefits of efficiency. **[In contrast / Likewise]**, Article C emphasizes the speed of the system." (Agreement)

### Activity 3: Synthesis Builder
*   **Type:** Reorder Paragraph
*   **Task:** Arrange sentences to form a synthesized paragraph.
    1.  [Topic Sentence: Scholars are divided on the ethics of FRT.]
    2.  [While Article A suggests parents are comfortable with the technology,]
    3.  [Article B argues that this comfort comes from a lack of real choice.]
    4.  [Thus, the perceived acceptance may be misleading.]

## Key Takeaway
"Synthesis is about the *conversation* between the texts. Your job is to host that conversation. 'Article A says X, BUT Article B says Y' is the most basic synthesis move. Master it."
