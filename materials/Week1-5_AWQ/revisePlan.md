we have two plans above for week 1-5

now we need to create 3 lessons for each week
the lesson would be like /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/UE1/materials/Week1-5_AWQ/sample_paraphrasing.html 

let's work out a revised plan for each week

please create a new file plan15.md with a plan for a total 15 pages (3 for each week)
make sure that week 4 would include a practice session and week 5 would include a feedback session
